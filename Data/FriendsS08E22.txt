[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is showing everyone a poster as Ross enters.]

Ross: Hey! What are you guys looking at?

Joey: Oh, it<U+0092>s a poster for that World War I movie that I<U+0092>m in, check
it out.

Ross: Yeah? Wow! It looks really violent!

Joey: Uh-huh! I know. I<U+0092>m coming soon to a theater near you! I<U+0092>m in
THX! I<U+0092>m unsuitable for children!

Ross: Now I cannot wait to see this.

Joey: Yeah, yeah, it<U+0092>s already generating Oscar buzz.

Phoebe: I started that!

Joey: I thought I did! Oh hey guess what? The premiere is next week and
you<U+0092>re all invited! (They all gasp.)

Monica: Are we gonna take a limo?

Joey: Sure! Why not?!

Monica: Oh I love taking limos when nobody died!

Rachel: Well obviously I won<U+0092>t be able to come, for those of you who
haven<U+0092>t checked their calendars today is my due date. Well y<U+0092>know, I just want
to take a moment and thank you guys for how great you<U+0092>ve been during this time. I
really couldn<U+0092>t have done it without you. And I have loved these last nine
months! And even though I am so looking forward to the next part, I am really gonna miss
being pregnant.

[Scene: Central Perk, time lapse, and Rachel is entering still pregnant.]

Rachel: That<U+0092>s right, still no baby! (To Monica, Joey, and Chandler on the
couch) Come on people! Please make some room!

Ross: Uh sweetie, maybe you<U+0092>d be more comfortable here? (Gets up from the
green armchair.)

Rachel: You. Like you haven<U+0092>t done enough.

Ross: Look, I-I know how miserable you are, I wish there was something I can do.
I mean I wish I were a seahorse. (She glares at him) Because with seahorses it<U+0092>s the
male, they carry the babies. And then also umm, I<U+0092>d be far away in the sea. (He sits
back down.)

(Rachel turns and looks at the group on the couch and they move over. Chandler measures
the room they<U+0092>ve made with his arm and decides it<U+0092>s not enough and they all move
over again.)

Rachel: God. (Sits down.) I have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life!

Phoebe: Oh I know, I<U+0092>ve been there. I remember toward the end<U+0085>

Rachel: (interrupting her) Oh Phoebe, that<U+0092>s a great story. Can you tell it
to me when you<U+0092>re getting me some iced tea? (Phoebe gets up and Rachel groans.) (To
the baby) Oh God, get out! Get out!! Get out!! Get out!!

Chandler: Let<U+0092>s. (Everyone gets up and leaves Rachel.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Monica are there as Rachel
enters.]

Chandler: Hey! Did you have the baby yet?

Rachel: Do you want me to come over there and sit on you? <U+0091>Cause I<U+0092>ll
do it.

Monica: What are you doing here so early?

Rachel: They sent me home from work. They were like, "Start your maternity
leave now! Just rest, get ready for the baby." Well y<U+0092>know what? Screw <U+0091>em!
If they don<U+0092>t want me there, I<U+0092>ll just hang out with you guys.

Phoebe: Or you can do volunteer work.

(Joey<U+0092>s cell phone rings and he answers it.)

Joey: Hello?

Estelle: Joey! It<U+0092>s Estelle! Great news, I was able to get you and one
guest tickets to your premiere.

Joey: One guest? You told me I can have six tickets!

Estelle: Well, I sold four of them on Ebay. You<U+0092>ll be sitting next
to HotGuy372.

Joey: Oh my God. So that<U+0092>s it?! I only get to bring one guest?

Estelle: Yeah, what time do you wanna pick me up? (Joey hangs up on her.) Hello?

Joey: (to Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe) Did you hear that? I only get one extra
ticket to my premiere. So some how I have to pick between you three and Ross.

Rachel: (overhearing that) What-what about me?

Joey: You said you didn<U+0092>t want to go.

Rachel: I don<U+0092>t. But I would still like to be acknowledged. What? Just
because I<U+0092>m pregnant you think I<U+0092>m invisible.

Joey: Definitely not invisible.

Monica: Well, well Ross didn<U+0092>t care enough to be here, so I think he<U+0092>s
out. You snooze you lose.

Chandler: He<U+0092>s not snoozing, he<U+0092>s teaching a class.

Monica: Well then somebody<U+0092>s snoozing. Joey, not that this uh should affect
you at all, but if you were to pick me, I was planning on wearing a sequined dress, cut
down to here. (Points to her stomach just above her belly button.)

Chandler: I haven<U+0092>t seen this dress.

Monica: Star in a movie.

Phoebe: Joey, you pick who ever you want. Okay? You just listen to your heart.
What does it tell you? (Mimicking a heartbeat and tapping her chest.) Phoebe, Phoebe.

Joey: Well uh<U+0085>I think I want to take Chandler.

Phoebe: (still mimicking a heartbeat, only faster)
Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe-Phoebe<U+0097>Burrrrr! (Mimics the sound of a cardiac monitor going
off.)

Chandler: You really want to take me?

Joey: Yeah! Yeah! I mean I<U+0092>m sorry, I wish I can take everybody, but
y<U+0092>know Chandler always supported my career. He<U+0092>s paid for acting classes and
head shots and stuff and well this will be my way of paying you back.

Chandler: So you<U+0092>re never actually going to pay me back?

Monica: Wait a minute, just because he paid for your head shots you<U+0092>re
gonna take him? Joey, I don<U+0092>t think you<U+0092>re comprehending just how slutty this
dress is!

Joey: It<U+0092>s not just the stuff he paid for, I mean it<U+0092>s-it<U+0092>s
everything. Y<U+0092>know? He read lines with me. He-he went with me on auditions when I was
really nervous, and then he consoled me after I didn<U+0092>t get parts that I really
wanted. You always believed in me man. Even, even when I didn<U+0092>t believe in myself.

Chandler: I always knew you were gonna make it. I<U+0092>m so proud of you.

Joey: Thanks. That means a lot to me.

(They look at each other and smile for a while.)

Phoebe: Mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.

Joey: (in a manly voice) I<U+0092>m gonna go shave. (Gets up.)

Chandler: (in a manly voice) Yeah well, I<U+0092>m gonna go spit. (He goes into
the bedroom. On his way out, Joey gives Rachel a wide berth.)

Rachel: Oh, I have to pee. If I don<U+0092>t come out in five minutes it<U+0092>s
because I<U+0092>ve choked to death on the potpourri stink. (Goes into the bathroom.)

Phoebe: When she comes out, you hold her nose, I<U+0092>ll blow in her mouth, and
the kid will just (makes a popping sound) right out of her.

Monica: She<U+0092>s over a week late! She gotta have it today, right?

Phoebe: I don<U+0092>t know. I-I think it<U+0092>s still gonna be a while.

Monica: Hmm, care to make it interesting? I<U+0092>ll bet you that she<U+0092>ll
have it by this time tomorrow.

Phoebe: You<U+0092>re on!

Monica: Okay, how much?

Phoebe: One hundred thousand dollars!

Monica: How about fifty bucks?

Phoebe: Fine! I<U+0092>ll call Zurich and move some money around.

Rachel: (calling from the bathroom) All right, who<U+0092>s turn is it to help me
get up!

(They both look at each other, then Phoebe gets an idea.)

Phoebe: No one<U+0092>s here! (Monica looks at her.) Oh damnit!

[Scene: The World Premiere of Over There, Joey and Chandler are arriving in a limo and
are about to walk down the red carpet.]

Chandler: This is so exciting! It<U+0092>s so glamorous! People taking our
picture. How do I look?

Joey: A little tall.

Chandler: What?

Joey: Do you mind crouching down a little bit, so that I look taller? (Chandler
does so) There you go. (And they walk down the red carpet.)

Chandler: It<U+0092>s just so glamorous.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is entering, still pregnant.]

Phoebe: Oh hey Mon? Rach is here! Ohh, you<U+0092>re still pregnant. Oh, I<U+0092>m
sorry. I know how uncomfortable you are. Y<U+0092>know what? You look great. Yeah, like
fifty bucks.

Rachel: Oh, I have to go pee. Apparently this baby thinks that my bladder is a
squeeze toy. (Goes to the bathroom.)

Monica: Damnit! Damnit!! Here<U+0092>s your fifty bucks! (Pays Phoebe.)

Phoebe: It<U+0092>s interesting that you lost. Now, I forget, do you like to lose?

Monica: Now stop it! Double or nothing that she has it by tomorrow!

Phoebe: Fine! You<U+0092>re on!

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Until then, General Grant, why don<U+0092>t you set up camp (She puts the
bill in her bra) right there.

Ross: (entering) Hey is Rachel here? We have a doctor<U+0092>s appointment.

Monica: She<U+0092>s in the bathroom.

Ross: Rach, we gotta go.

Rachel: In a minute!!!

Ross: People ask me why we<U+0092>re not together, I just don<U+0092>t know what to
tell them.

Rachel: (entering) All right, all right. Let<U+0092>s go!

Ross: Uh, do you wanna go change first? The doctor<U+0092>s keeping the office
open late for us, but if you hurry<U+0085>

Rachel: No, I<U+0092>m fine.

Ross: Really? You don<U+0092>t think that<U+0092>s a little inappropriate.
(She<U+0092>s wearing a tank top and has her belly sticking out.)

Phoebe: Good God man don<U+0092>t anger it.

Rachel: Ross, it is 100 degrees outside. For the first time in weeks, I am
somewhat comfortable.

Ross: Fine! Fine! Y<U+0092>know what? Whatever you want. Okay? You<U+0092>re the
mommy.

Rachel: Oh uh-uh pal! Don<U+0092>t call me mommy! It<U+0092>s bad enough you call
your own mother that. (He looks at Monica.)

Monica: I<U+0092>m actually with her on this one.

[Scene: Inside Joey<U+0092>s Premiere, he is intently watching the movie.]

Joey: (onscreen) "I thought I knew who the enemy was, but it was you all
along." 

Joey: (To Chandler) Okay, this is it. It<U+0092>s my big fight scene coming up.
(He looks over and Chandler and notices that he<U+0092>s asleep.)

[Scene: Dr. Long<U+0092>s Office, Ross and Rachel are waiting for the doctor. Ross is
drumming his fingers on the bed.]

Rachel: Ross.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: Can I ask you something?

Ross: Uh-huh.

Rachel: When Carol was pregnant with Ben<U+0085>

Ross: Mmm?

Rachel: <U+0085>were you this irritating?

Ross: Wow!

Rachel: Excuse me?!

Ross: Oh nothing. Nothing! Just uh, you<U+0092>ve been a little short with me
lately. I<U+0092>m not trying to irritate you.

Rachel: Well then you just must have a natural talent for it.

Ross: Y<U+0092>know what? The doctor will be in soon, why don<U+0092>t we not speak
until then.

Rachel: (silently) Okay. (Pause) Seriously, breathe louder Ross! That<U+0092>s
great!

Ross: Y<U+0092>know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to
deliver a baby that<U+0092>s half human and half pure evil!

(Dr. Long enters.)

Rachel: Hi Dr. Long, how are you?

Ross: (to Rachel) Oh, you<U+0092>re nice to her.

Rachel: She has the drugs!

Dr. Long: We<U+0092>ll do a quick check.

Rachel: Okay. (Rachel lies back.)

Dr. Long: So, eight days late huh?

Rachel: Yeah.

Dr. Long: You must be a little uncomfortable.

Rachel: Eh, just a tad.

Dr. Long: You<U+0092>re about 80 percent effaced, so you<U+0092>re on your way. It
still could last a little while longer. If you<U+0092>re anxious there are a few ways to
help things along.

Ross: Do them!!

Dr. Long: Actually, they<U+0092>re things you can do. Just some home remedies, but
in my experience I<U+0092>ve found that some of them are quite effective.

Rachel: Well, we are ready to try anything.

Dr. Long: Okay, there<U+0092>s an herbal tea you can drink.

Rachel: Okay.

Dr. Long: You can take some caster oil, there<U+0092>s eating spicy foods<U+0085>

Rachel: Great! We will do all of those.

Dr. Long: <U+0085>taking a long walk, and then there<U+0092>s the one that<U+0092>s
proved most effective: sex.

(Rachel turns and looks at Ross.)

Ross: You<U+0092>ve got to be kidding me!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Joey<U+0092>s Premiere, the movie is ending and it takes the applause to wake up
Chandler.]

Chandler: Good job Joe! Well done! Top notch!

Joey: You liked it? You really liked it?

Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, yeah!

Joey: Which part exactly?

Chandler: The whole thing! Can we go?

Joey: Oh no-no-no, give me some specifics.

Chandler: I love the specifics, the specifics were the best part!

Joey: Hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? Did-did you like that part?

Chandler: I was surprised to see a kangaroo in a World War I epic.

Joey: You fell asleep!! There was no kangaroo! They didn<U+0092>t take any of my
suggestions! That<U+0092>s for coming buddy. I<U+0092>ll see you later. (Starts to walk out.)

Chandler: Don<U+0092>t go! I<U+0092>m sorry. I<U+0092>m so sorry! (Sees another guy
who is still asleep.) Look! This guy fell asleep! He fell asleep too! Be mad at him!
(Looks at him more closely.) Or, call an ambulance.

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Rachel are there as Phoebe and Monica enter.]

Monica: Hey!

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Hi!

Monica: What did the doctor say? Any news on when the baby will come?

Rachel: No. But she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor.

Ross: Yeah, we tried them all. We went for a walk, uh we tried a special tea,
caster oil, spicy food nothing has worked.

Rachel: Well, there is one thing that we haven<U+0092>t tried, but someone thinks
that, (mimicking Ross) "That will open up a can of worms."

Monica: Well what is it? What is it? If it<U+0092>s gonna help bring the baby
here, like today. I mean, I think you should do it.

Ross: It<U+0092>s sex.

Monica: Do it!

Ross: Monica!

Monica: I<U+0092>m just saying it<U+0092>s been a really long time for you. I mean,
women have needs. Do it, get yours!

Phoebe: Oh I-I don<U+0092>t know about that. No, I think that if the two of you
had sex the-the-the repercussions would be catastrophic. 

Monica: All right, let<U+0092>s be practical, if Ross isn<U+0092>t willing to do it,
he<U+0092>s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with. You can borrow
Chandler<U+0097>Chandler is good!

Ross: Monica, what is the matter with you?

Monica: Nothing. I just want the baby to be born today.

Rachel: Why? Why today?

Monica: Okay fine! I keep betting Phoebe that you<U+0092>re gonna have the baby
and I don<U+0092>t want to lose again!

Ross: What?! While she<U+0092>s been going through this hell, you<U+0092>ve been
making money?! You<U+0092>re betting on your friend staying in this misery?! (Phoebe lowers
her head and shakes it yes.)

Rachel: I<U+0092>ll take that bet.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Well, I<U+0092>m miserable here! I might as well make some money out it!

Ross: Can I get some of that action?

Monica: Wait a minute! Now I<U+0092>m betting against all three of you?

Rachel: Oh honey, don<U+0092>t worry. I really do feel like tomorrow<U+0092>s the
day.

Monica: Oh, okay!

(Rachel turns her head to Ross and Phoebe and mouths, "No way.")

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is there as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey! Sleeping beauty!

Chandler: Where have you been?! I tried to call you! I want to talk to you! I
still feel so bad!

Joey: (in a baby voice) Oh no, were you upset? Did you lose sleep?

Chandler: I<U+0092>m so sorry.

Joey: Uh-huh look, the only reason I can over here was to settle things between
us! Okay? You<U+0092>ve done a lot for me and my career, I wanted to pay you back so I took
you to the premiere but you missed it! Okay, so how much do I owe you?

Chandler: What?!

Joey: Give me a number, I don<U+0092>t want to owe you anything!

Chandler: You don<U+0092>t owe me anything, I don<U+0092>t want you money<U+0085>

Joey: Ah-ah-ah! We<U+0092>re doing this! Okay, now you got me my first set of head
shots. Right, how much were those?

Chandler: I don<U+0092>t know, five hundred dollars?

Joey: Okay, five hundred dollars. What else?

Chandler: Well then there was the second set, the infamous booger head shots.

Joey: Okay, so that<U+0092>s another five hundred. Five hundred and five hundred,
that<U+0092>s<U+0085> (Pauses to figure it out.)

Chandler: Do you want a calculator?

Joey: Please! 

Chandler: Here! (Hands him one. Joey adds it up and discovers that he was
right.)

Joey: All right, what else?

Chandler: Well uh, there was acting classes, stage combat classes, tap
classes<U+0085>

Joey: Which we<U+0092>re still keeping under our hats!

Chandler: Uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play
where you needed a southern accent. Which after twenty hours of lessons still came out
Jamaican. 

Joey: What the hell are you talking about, (in a Jamaican accent) "The
south will rise again man."

Chandler: Yes, money well spent!

Joey: Yeah. Okay, what else? Rent!

Chandler: Okay, two, three years of rent, utilities, food<U+0085>

Joey: Okay. Okay, so I<U+0092>m writing you a check for<U+0085>So you fell asleep
during my movie. Big deal right? How do you clear this thing?

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross and Rachel are trying the home remedies again.]

Ross: Come on, finish your enchilada.

Rachel: Ross I<U+0097>We tried all the spicy food. It<U+0092>s not working.

Ross: Okay here, have one of these peppers. Oh ha<U+0085> Oh God! So<U+0085>so hot!
(Rubs his eyes.) Oh my<U+0097>(Laughs.) By the way, you don<U+0092>t want to touch the pepper
and then touch your eye.

Rachel: I am feeling nothing. Speaking of hot, watching you do that really makes
me want to have sex with you.

Ross: Stop it.

Rachel: Oh come on Ross, why are we wasting our time with this other stuff?! We
know what<U+0092>s gonna work! It<U+0092>s doctor recommended!

Ross: I<U+0092>m sorry, but we have to have some boundaries! My God, I<U+0092>m
dying.

Rachel: Oh come on Ross, we<U+0092>ve done it before we<U+0092>ll do it again,
it<U+0092>ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.

Ross: This is insane, I<U+0092>m not gonna make love to you just so that
you<U+0092>ll go into labor.

Rachel: Make love? What are you a girl?

Ross: Always a great way to get in a man<U+0092>s pants.

Rachel: But you will, you will be performing a service. Okay? Just-just think of
me as a ketchup bottle, y<U+0092>know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just
to get something to come out.

Ross: I love when you talk dirty to me.

Rachel: Oh, I know it. You<U+0092>re right. That<U+0092>s not sexy. Oh<U+0085>Oh!
(Drops a fork on the floor.) Whoops! Oh, I seem to have dropped my fork. Let me just bed
over and get it. (Tries too, but can<U+0092>t quite seem to make it.) Oh God!

Ross: Okay enough! This is, this is not going to happen.

Rachel: Come on Ross! I<U+0092>m miserable here! Come on! You started this, now
you finish it! Come on wuss, make love to me.

Ross: Y<U+0092>know what?

Rachel: What?!

Ross: Forget it.

Rachel: Oh wow! What now Ross you<U+0092>re not gonna talk? How on earth will you
ever annoy me? Oh wait a minute, I know. (Mimics his breathing.) I mean you<U+0092>d think
the damn jalepeno would<U+0092>ve cleared up your sinuses, but no!! That<U+0092>s not
enough<U+0085> (Ross jumps over and kisses her.) What are you doing?!

Ross: I<U+0092>m getting that baby out of you!

(They kiss again.)

Rachel: (breaking the kiss) Oh God!

Ross: Oh, I know.

Rachel: Oh no. No-no! I think my water just broke.

Ross: I am good. Okay! Okay! Uh, I got the pillow! I got the bag! You got the
keys?

Rachel: Okay! I got the keys! Okay! Okay!

Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: We<U+0092>re having a baby.

(They hug and then kiss one more time.)

Rachel: I didn<U+0092>t uh, really have time to read this part of the books, but
do you think we have time to<U+0085>

Ross: Not so much.

Rachel: Okay.

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is paying Phoebe.]

Monica: Two hundred.

Phoebe: Thank you!

Monica: That<U+0092>s it. I<U+0092>m done. I don<U+0092>t care when the baby comes, no
more betting.

Phoebe: Okay.

(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)

Monica: Hello? (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Uh-huh. (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up.) I
guess we can bet one more time.

Phoebe: Is Rachel having the baby?

Monica: How did you know that?! (Runs to yell at Joey<U+0092>s apartment.) Joey!
Chandler!! It<U+0092>s time!

Phoebe: They<U+0092>re at the coffeehouse.

Monica: You know everything!! Oh wait, double or nothing. I bet you the baby is
over seven pounds. (Phoebe isn<U+0092>t interested.) I bet you it has hair. (She<U+0092>s
still not interested.) I bet you it<U+0092>s a girl.

Phoebe: We know it<U+0092>s a girl! (Exits.)

Monica: (following her) I<U+0092>ll give you really good odds.
