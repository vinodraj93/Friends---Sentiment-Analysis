Lisa Kudrow: (voiceover) Previously on Friends

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is talking to Ross]


Joey: There<U+0092>s this woman, that I like.  A lot.  Well, it<U+0092>s
complicated.  She<U+0092>s with this other guy.  For a long time.  And I
could never do that to the guy, y<U+0092>know?  <U+0092>Ccause we<U+0092>re really good
friends.


Ross: So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh<U+0085> is he a good guy?


Joey: Yeah, he<U+0092>s the best.


Ross: Then talk to him! He might be fine with it.


Joey: Oh, I don<U+0092>t know.


Ross: Joey, it<U+0092>s worth finding out. I mean, if you really like her.


Joey: I do! So much! I can<U+0092>t stop thinking about her! I can<U+0092>t sleep,
I<U+0097>


Ross: Okay, Joey, you know what? You have to go for it. How often does this happen
to you, huh? You owe it to yourself. (Walks towards the door until<U+0085>)


Joey: It<U+0092>s Rachel.

[Fade to Black, then fade in again with Ross stopped at the doorway.]

Ross: (closes the door) Did you um<U+0097>I<U+0092>m sorry, did you just say
it<U+0092>s Rachel?

Joey: Yes.

Ross: Um, you<U+0085>you like Rachel?

Joey: Yes. I like Rachel.

Ross: Rachel?!

Joey: (startled) Yeah, okay but look, buy uh<U+0097>Hey-hey, y<U+0092>know,
y<U+0092>know who else I like? You! And it-it doesn<U+0092>t get said enough. I like you Ross.

Ross: But R-R-Rachel-Rachel?! 

Joey: Yeah, but it<U+0092>s not a big deal.

Ross: It<U+0092>s not a big deal? Oh, I<U+0092>m sorry I just<U+0085>um, I<U+0085>what
about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like<U+0097>you-you can<U+0092>t
stop thinking about her. Like how you can<U+0092>t sleep?

Joey: I<U+0092>m an actor, y<U+0092>know? As-as a group, we tend to be over
dramatic.

Ross: Rachel who<U+0092>s carrying my baby? Rachel?

Joey: Look no, I-I know it<U+0092>s bad, and I know it<U+0092>s wrong. Okay? But-but
it<U+0092>s not like anything<U+0092>s ever gonna happen. Y<U+0092>know? These-these are just
feelings, they<U+0092>re gonna go away.

Ross: Y<U+0092>know what? I-I gotta go. (Starts to leave.)

Joey: Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don<U+0092>t<U+0085>

Ross: (stops) I just<U+0097>y<U+0092>know<U+0097>I-I just have one<U+0097>Rachel?! 

(He exits and starts to walk away, passes a window, stops, and says
"Rachel?!" again. Joey sighs and turns around to face Gunther.)

Gunther: Rachel?!!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Chandler are on the couch.]

Rachel: Oh-oh! Okay, she<U+0092>s kicking!

Chandler: Oh! (Puts his hand on her belly.) She<U+0092>s growing inside you.

Rachel: Whoa!!

Chandler: Oh! (Pulls his hand away.)

Rachel: Wow that was a big one.

Chandler: I think that<U+0092>s the youngest girl ever to reject me.

Phoebe: (entering) Oh hey you guys!

Chandler: Oh hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Phoebe: Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?

Rachel: Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there
for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That<U+0092>s why
I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He<U+0092>ll find me.

Phoebe: Uh-huh, (To Chandler) and you?

Chandler: No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each
other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don<U+0092>t think they exist.

Phoebe: Okay, good.

Chandler: Why?

Phoebe: Well last night, I met Monica<U+0092>s.

Chandler: What?

Phoebe: Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other
half.

Chandler: Come on, don<U+0092>t be crazy. (To Rachel) You don<U+0092>t think
there<U+0092>s someone out there better suited for Monica than me, do ya? (Rachel looks at
him.)

Rachel: (To Phoebe) Well, what<U+0092>s he like?!

Phoebe: Well he<U+0092>s tall.

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Phoebe: He has brown hair.

Rachel: Of course, of course.

Chandler: A tall guy with hair similar to mine, oh unknowable universe!

Phoebe: He works with food!

Rachel: Oh sure. Older?

Phoebe: Obviously, and he<U+0092>s British.

Rachel: Oh, I was just gonna ask!

Phoebe: Yeah? And, he<U+0092>s-he<U+0092>s so centered and mature and confident.

Rachel: Oh, it<U+0092>s so sad they never had a chance to meet.

Chandler: Luckily, the guy she settled for can<U+0092>t hear what you<U+0092>re
talking about.

Phoebe: Oh, I<U+0092>m so sorry. Um, and maybe I<U+0092>m wrong! I
but<U+0097>y<U+0092>know I<U+0092>m gonna go out with him again, I<U+0092>ll find out more.

Chandler: You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you<U+0092>re
still gonna date him?

Phoebe: Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl<U+0092>s gotta eat.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's, Ross is opening the door to Monica.]

Monica: Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Monica: I just talked to Joey, I just<U+0097>I want to see how you were.

Ross: Oh y<U+0092>know, I still<U+0097>I can<U+0092>t believe it. Joey and Rachel I
mean it<U+0092>s<U+0085> It<U+0092>s like you and me going out, only weirder!

Monica: All right, I know you<U+0092>re hurting, and-and I want to be supportive,
but don<U+0092>t say that again.

Ross: Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he<U+0092>d be the
stepfather of my child.

Monica: Honey, I don<U+0092>t think that<U+0092>s something we need to worry about!
First of all he<U+0092>s-he<U+0092>s never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if
he did you have no idea how she<U+0092>d react.

Ross: Sure, because women never like Joey. Y<U+0092>know, I think he<U+0092>s a
virgin.

Monica: Joey<U+0085>he<U+0092>s not even thinking about going after Rachel!

Ross: He<U+0092>s not?

Monica: No! All he<U+0092>s thinking about is how you<U+0092>re taking this! I mean,
listen it<U+0092>s totally freaking him out. He<U+0092>s talking about moving to Vermont.

Ross: Why?

Monica: He says he wants to leave the country. (Pause) He thinks you hate him.

Ross: Hate him? I<U+0085> No, I don<U+0092>t hate him. (Pause) It<U+0092>s just
it<U+0092>s Rachel, y<U+0092>know?

Monica: Honey I can<U+0092>t even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I
don<U+0092>t want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that
you<U+0092>re still his friend.

Ross: Okay. Okay, I<U+0092>ll talk to him.

Monica: All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars
into Vermont money.

[Scene: Central Perk, Monica and Chandler are on the couch as Phoebe enters with
Monica<U+0092>s soul mate.]

Phoebe: Oh! Hi!

Monica: Hi!

Phoebe: Umm, Chandler, Monica, this is Don.

Don: Oh, hello. (Shakes Chandler<U+0092>s hand.) Hello. (Shakes Monica<U+0092>s
hand.)

Phoebe: (mouths to Chandler) Soul mate.

Chandler: (mouths to Phoebe) What?

Phoebe: (cough talks) Soul mate.

Monica: So, what have you guys been doing?

Don: Well, we just had a terrible lunch today at Reattica. What is with all the
sun-dried tomatoes at that place?

Monica: I know! What is this, 1985?!

Don: That<U+0092>s exactly what I said. Phoebe, isn<U+0092>t that strange.

Monica: Not really.

Chandler: What<U+0092>s wrong with sun-dried tomatoes? (Everyone stares at him.)
On a barbecue chicken pizza? (Still there<U+0092>s staring.) No?

Monica: So Don, what-what other restaurants do you like?

Don: Well, Octavio, 27&7<U+0097>Oh! And there<U+0092>s this great little place,
Alessandro<U+0092>s.

Monica: Oh my God! That<U+0092>s my restaurant, I<U+0092>m the chef there.

Don: You<U+0092>re kidding me!

Monica: No!

Don: Your food is fantastic! Wow, I really want to talk to you about your menu,
once I get some coffees first. Um, anyone want any?

Monica: Oh, I<U+0092>d like a latte. Oh y<U+0092>know what? If you<U+0092>re gonna
talk about me, I<U+0092>m gonna go with you. 

(They go over to the counter and Chandler moves closer to Phoebe.)

Chandler: What are you doing?!

Phoebe: Nothing! I swear to God I didn<U+0092>t know you guys would be here! And
the good news is you didn<U+0092>t believe in soul mates. So<U+0085>

Chandler: I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!

Phoebe: They<U+0092>re just talking, and y<U+0092>know what? Just because I think
they<U+0092>re soul mates doesn<U+0092>t mean anything<U+0092>s gonna happen.

Monica: (returning) Phoebe, good work.

Phoebe: Yeah?

Monica: Yeah! Oh he<U+0092>s great, I love him. (Walks away and Chandler glares at
Phoebe.)

Phoebe: Don<U+0092>t worry, we<U+0092>ll find you someone else.

[Scene: Joey<U+0092>s Apartment, there<U+0092>s a knock on the door and Joey answers it to
Ross.]

Joey: Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Joey: Look, I understand if you came by to hit me, I deserve it.

Ross: No, I don<U+0092>t want to hit you.

Joey: Oh what then? Kick me?

Ross: No.

Joey: (getting worried) Bite me?

Ross: No, no I don<U+0092>t want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to
tell you that I<U+0092>m not mad at you and<U+0085>and that I certainly do not hate you. I
just, I just came here to say that. (Starts to leave.)

Joey: Oh now<U+0097>Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or
something?

Ross: Uh<U+0085>yeah sure. (Enters.)

Joey: Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel
left. I don<U+0092>t<U+0085>

Ross: Okay.

Joey: (pouring two glasses) Hey look Ross, you need to understand something
okay? I uh<U+0085>I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do
anything to jeopardize my friendship with you. (He hands Ross a glass.)

Ross: Thank you.

(They clink glasses and take a drink. Ross likes it, Joey hates it. Then Ross sees Joey
hating it, mimics he hates it as well.)

Joey: Anyway, it uh<U+0085>look it<U+0092>ll just<U+0085>take me a while to get over
her, that<U+0092>s all. I<U+0092>m not even sure how to do that, I mean I<U+0092>ve never been
in love before so<U+0085>

Ross: What?! You<U+0092>re in love with her.

Joey: Yeah, I thought you knew that.

Ross: Umm, no.

Joey: Wow. Hey look, if it helps, I don<U+0092>t want to feel this way. Honest. I
just keep thinking, "Ah, I<U+0092>ll get over this." Y<U+0092>know? I just<U+0097>It
just keeps gettin<U+0092> harder. I don<U+0092>t, I don<U+0092>t know what to do. Y<U+0092>know?
What do I do?

(Pause)

Ross: I think you need to tell her how you feel.

Joey: Okay that<U+0092>s the green stuff talkin<U+0092>.

Ross: No, I<U+0092>m serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if
she<U+0092>s not where you are, then you can start to move past this.

Joey: But what if uh<U+0097>and I<U+0092>m not saying she will be<U+0097>But<U+0085>

Ross: If she is where you are then uh<U+0085>then my feeling weird about it
shouldn<U+0092>t stand in the way.

Joey: Are you sure?

Ross: Yeah. Look if-if she<U+0092>s gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is
she couldn<U+0092>t find a better guy. So<U+0085>

Joey: Hey thanks.

Ross: So when do you think you<U+0092>re gonna talk to her?

Joey: Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven<U+0092>t even thought about what I
will say. What should I say?

Ross: I<U+0092>m understanding, but let<U+0092>s not get carried away.

Joey: I<U+0092>m sorry, you<U+0092>re right. What am I gonna say? (He takes another
sip of the green stuff and recoils at the taste.) Oh!

Ross: Yeah, tell me about it. (He stands up, turns his back to Joey, and enjoys
another sip.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Chandler are watching Monica and Don talk.]

Don: <U+0085>so I<U+0092>ve been slowly phasing out the wine importing and focusing
more on the cheese side of things.

Chandler: Cheese you say? That<U+0092>s some pretty smelly work, huh Don?

Don: Excuse me?

Chandler: Cheese, it<U+0092>s smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.

Don: Uh, not really. But when it comes to cheese, I<U+0092>m one of the people who
thinks the smellier the better.

Monica: Me too! Yeah, Chandler can<U+0092>t stand it. He won<U+0092>t even allow me
to have blue cheese in the house.

Don: And you<U+0092>re still married to him? (They both laugh, and Chandler tries
to but fails.)

Monica: You know what I<U+0092>d love to do? I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese<U+0097>Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah.
Ah, and pastries<U+0085> (Breathlessly) And pate. Oh, I<U+0092>m really not high, it<U+0092>s
just I used to be fat.

Don: Well if you where ever enter the Loire valley let me know, I<U+0092>ve got a
great little villa you can stay at.

Chandler: Is it made of cheese?

Don: No. But God, a house made of cheese, wouldn<U+0092>t that be incredible?!

Monica: I<U+0092>d move in tomorrow!

Chandler: (disgusted) Oh come on! (To Phoebe) Are you listening to this?

Phoebe: I<U+0092>m so sorry.

Chandler: What do we do?

Phoebe: I don<U+0092>t know, they both want to live in a house of cheese! I
don<U+0092>t know how you fight that.

[Scene: Outside Ross and Rachel's, Joey walks up to knock on the door, but stops.]

Joey: Okay. Okay, I can do this. I can tell her how I feel. Just uh, just stand
up straight. (Does so.) Take a couple deep breaths. (Does so.) Look confident. (Does so as
Rachel opens the door and startles him.)

Rachel: Joey? What<U+0092>s up?

Joey: I uh, I just came by because I-I want to talk to you about something.

Rachel: Okay what<U+0092>s up?

Joey: Here? In the hall? What are we animals?

Rachel: Well honey, I<U+0092>m late for a meeting. So can you just make it quick?

Joey: Okay umm, I just came by to tell you that I<U+0085>want to have dinner with
you tonight. That<U+0092>s all.

Rachel: Sure! That sounds great! Just leave me a message and tell me where to
meet you. Okay? (Walks away.)

Joey: Okay. That<U+0092>s good. Okay, that give you a couple hours to prepare what
you<U+0092>re gonna say. Good. Yeah. (Someone comes out of his apartment and it startles
Joey again.) Don<U+0092>t you people ever knock?!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are entering.]

Monica: I<U+0092>d like to have Don and Phoebe over. Wouldn<U+0092>t that be nice?

Chandler: Sure, why don<U+0092>t you set it up. I<U+0092>ll just be over here,
browsing through the personals.

Monica: Are you okay? You<U+0092>ve been acting weird all afternoon.

Chandler: Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.

Monica: Jeez! What is with you?

Chandler: I<U+0092>m sorry, did you say cheese?

Monica: All right, what<U+0092>s going on?

Chandler: Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don<U+0092>t believe in
that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won<U+0092>t stand in
your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.

Monica: Chandler, you don<U+0092>t believe in soul mates?

Chandler: No. But I<U+0092>m sure (mimics Don) <U+0091>tomatoes<U+0092> does.

Monica: I don<U+0092>t believe in soul mates either.

Chandler: You don<U+0092>t?

Monica: No. I don<U+0092>t think that you and I were destined to end up together.
I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really
hard.

Chandler: So you<U+0085>you don<U+0092>t want to live with Don in a cheese house?

Monica: No, I<U+0092>ve had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard
that would be to clean?

Chandler: I love you.

Monica: I know.

Chandler: Y<U+0092>know what? I am going to take you out to dinner tonight. I
found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalepino poppers . (Monica
doesn<U+0092>t look impressed.) No? Really? They taste so good.

[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are having dinner.]

Rachel: <U+0085>and I know Chandler is kidding but it happens every time he
touches my stomach. I mean I<U+0092>m really worried the baby<U+0092>s not going to like him.
(Joey is staring at the table.) Are you okay?

Joey: What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason<U+0085>(Exhales
slowly)<U+0097>Is it hot in here?

Rachel: No. Not-not for me, but why don<U+0092>t you take off your sweater?

Joey: I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin
doing Hobbs.

Rachel: Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?

Joey: Yeah. Sure. (They both half stand up, Joey pulls the neck of his sweater
out, and Rachel looks down it to see his T-shirt.)

Rachel: Huh. Wow, I wouldn<U+0092>t think Hobbs would like that so much.

Joey: Uh<U+0085> How long have we known each other?

Rachel: Um, seven<U+0085>e-e-eight, eight years. Wow.

Joey: Uh-huh, long time.

Rachel: Yeah.

Joey: But over the past few weeks<U+0085>

(A waiter runs over interrupting Joey.)

Waiter: Hah, sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here! We have a
couple specials tonight<U+0085>

Joey: Actually uh, could you give us a second?

Waiter: Sure. Sure. (Turns away, then turns back) Second<U+0092>s up! (Joey glares
at him.) Not<U+0085>that kind of table. (He walks away.)

Rachel: So you were saying?

Joey: I<U+0092>m not quite sure.

Rachel: Okay, well you had asked me how long we had known each other, and I
said, "Eight years." And the um, waiter came over and cut his tip in half, and
umm<U+0085>now here we are.

Joey: Yeah, here we are. Uhh<U+0085> I<U+0085> I think I<U+0092>m<U+0085>falling in love
with you.

Rachel: (stunned) What?

Joey: I<U+0092>m falling in love with you.

Rachel: (looking around) Who are you talking too? Oh, you<U+0092>re kidding! Oh,
it<U+0092>s a joke! (Laughs.) It<U+0092>s funny. It<U+0092>s funny. I don<U+0092>t get it. (Joey
doesn<U+0092>t say any thing and Rachel realizes it<U+0092>s not a joke.) Oh. (Pause) Okay.
Umm<U+0085> I-I<U+0085>uh, wow. Are you uh<U+0085> How did umm<U+0085> When?

Joey: Does it really matter?

Rachel: Wow! Wow. Wow. Wow, it is hot in here.

Joey: Okay look Rach, I know this is a lot. You don<U+0092>t have to say anything.
You-you uh, you take as much time as you need. (Long pause as Rachel says nothing.) Okay,
you gotta say something!

Rachel: Joey, Joey I love you so much, but I<U+0085>

Joey: But. (Hangs his head down.)

Rachel: Joey.

Joey: Yeah-yeah right. That<U+0092>s okay. That<U+0092>s fine. That<U+0092>s uh,
pretty much what I was expecting. So uh, it<U+0092>s no big deal. All right? I think
I<U+0092>m gonna go. (Stands up.)

Rachel: No! Joey please! Please don<U+0092>t! Please don<U+0092>t leave like this!
Now come on, you cannot do this to a pregnant woman! (Starts to cry.)

Joey: Don<U+0092>t start doing that. You can<U+0092>t do that Rach, <U+0091>cause then
you<U+0092>re gonna make me do that. (Starts to cry.) Oh, here we go! (Sits down next to
her.)

Rachel: Can I? (Hug him.)

Joey: Sure! 

(They hug.)

Rachel: Oh Joey honey I don<U+0092>t<U+0085>I don<U+0092>t want to lose<U+0085>

Joey: Hey-hey-hey, hey! You can<U+0092>t. Okay? Ever!

Rachel: I<U+0092>m so sorry.

Joey: Oh no-no Rach, please, don<U+0092>t be sorry. Okay? Don<U+0092>t be sorry.
(They hug again.) Y<U+0092>know I was only kidding you.

Rachel: Yeah, that was a real good one.

Closing Credits

[Scene: A restaurant, Joey and Rachel are still hugging as a waiter walks by the table
to talk to the annoying waiter from before who is watching.]

Waiter No. 2: Is this your table?

Waiter: Yeah.

Waiter No. 2: God, you<U+0092>re gonna be here all night!

Waiter: I know! I haven<U+0092>t even read them the specials yet!

Waiter No. 2: What<U+0092>s the matter with them?

Waiter: I don<U+0092>t know. I think maybe one of them is dying. (Pause) I kinda
hope it<U+0092>s the girl. (The other waiter is shocked.) The guy is really cute!
