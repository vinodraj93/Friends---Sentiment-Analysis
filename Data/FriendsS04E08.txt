Transcribed by: Eric Aasen

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is sitting at the counter reading a magazine as the
phone rings.]

Joey: (answering phone) Hello.

Chandler: (on phone) Hey, it<U+0092>s me. I know you can<U+0092>t stand to be in the
same room as me, so I just thought I<U+0092>d try and apologize over the phone. All I<U+0085>
(Joey hangs up the phone in disgust.)

(Pause)

(The phone rings again.)

Joey: (answering phone) Hello.

Chandler: Look I never should have kissed your girlfriend, but I<U+0092>m<U+0085>
(Joey hangs up the phone again.)

(Pause)

(The phone rings yet again.)

Joey: (answering phone) Stop callin<U+0092>!!

Voice: (on phone) Hey! Hey! Hey! This is 92.3, WXRK, K-Rock for our $1,000 daily
challenge.

Joey: All right!

Voice: What is the name of your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do
anything<U+0085> (Joey realizes it<U+0092>s Chandler and hangs up the phone in anger.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone but Joey and Chandler are there getting ready for
Thanksgiving.]

Chandler: (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!

Phoebe: Look everyone, it<U+0092>s the spirit of Thanksgiving!

Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?

Chandler: They couldn<U+0092>t be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last
night, just trying to get him to talk to me.

Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those
plug-in telephone headsets huh?

Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen
from your office?

Rachel: You shouldn<U+0092>t.

Phoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new
business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then
we each only buy one gift. And-and there<U+0092>s the added mystery of who gets who.

Ross: Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I don<U+0092>t know why I do that.

[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]

Rachel: Well, I<U+0092>m gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.

Monica: We haven<U+0092>t eaten yet!

Rachel: I know, but all that work you<U+0092>re doing to get it ready, I
just<U+0085> (goes into her bedroom.)

Chandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa,
<U+0091>cause I wanna trade for her.

Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!

Chandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?

Phoebe: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, it<U+0092>s like
impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, let<U+0092>s trade!

Chandler: Oh that<U+0092>s not true! That<U+0092>s not true! I got her that backpack
and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off
with it<U+0085> (notices the look on Monica and Phoebe<U+0092>s faces.) Oh, there was no big
dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on
it<U+0085> (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initials<U+0085>

Phoebe: Ohh.

Monica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.

Chandler: Op, y'know what though, it<U+0092>s kind<U+0092>ve a girlie briefcase.

Monica: Who cares? He works in a museum!

Chandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!

Phoebe: You don<U+0092>t have to do that, Ross and Joey aren<U+0092>t here, you can
watch the parade if you want.

Chandler: Thanks.

Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and
a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!

Phoebe: God, what happened?!

Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!

Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!

Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.

Phoebe: Open it up, let me see.

Monica: Oh, y<U+0092>know what, I can<U+0092>t, it really kills.

Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.

Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.

Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.

Monica: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I can<U+0092>t go to him when I don<U+0092>t
have a boyfriend!

Chandler: He<U+0092>s really picky about his patients.

Phoebe: Honey, you<U+0092>ve got to go. What<U+0092>s his office number?

Monica: Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.

Phoebe: (on phone) Hi! Yeah, I<U+0092>m calling on behalf of Monica Geller<U+0092>s
eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) He<U+0092>s out of town,
but does she want to see the on-call doctor?

Monica: Yes!!

Phoebe: Yes! She<U+0092>s very excited about that.

[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]

Phoebe: This is so cool, <U+0091>til Monica gets back, it<U+0092>s like I<U+0092>m
head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and
then decides to add it to the dish.)

Ross: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!

Phoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!

Chandler: (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with
Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed
the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.

Phoebe: All right I<U+0085> I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking
question.

Ross: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but I<U+0092>m already
getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.

Chandler: Oh y<U+0092>know what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.

Ross: Really?! Wow! That<U+0092>s-that<U+0092>s so nice, what are you gonna get me?

Chandler: I don<U+0092>t know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your
office.

Ross: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

Chandler: Oh no-no-no, you don<U+0092>t want to do that, then you<U+0092>re gonna
get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

Ross: Oh, that<U+0092>s not true! I<U+0092>ve got her lots of stuff she never took
back.

Chandler: Like?

Ross: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.

Chandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?

Ross: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uh<U+0085>

Chandler: Big dog?

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.]

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: What are you doing?

Joey: I<U+0092>m sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.

Ross: Everything? Even the TV?

Joey: No! I<U+0092>m putting that in my room.

Ross: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but don<U+0092>t you think you
could at least hear the guy out?

Joey: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would
you hear him out?

Ross: That<U+0092>s a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?

Joey: Five years. 

Ross: You<U+0092>ve sentenced him?!

Joey: Hey! Don<U+0092>t do the crime if you can<U+0092>t do the time.

Ross: Joey, the guy<U+0092>s your best friend.

Joey: No, was my best friend. Anyway, I don<U+0092>t know why
you<U+0092>re pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend,
there<U+0092>s a spot open.

Ross: Oh, who? Me?

Joey: Yeah!

Ross: Wow! I<U+0092>m honored! And y<U+0092>know what I<U+0092>m gonna do as my first
act as your best friend?

Joey: What?

Ross: I<U+0092>m gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

Joey: All right. But if you weren<U+0092>t my best friend.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about
Joey.]

Kathy: Oh my God, is it really that bad?

Chandler: I walk into a room and he won<U+0092>t even talk to me, he just mumbles
something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.

Joey: (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?

Gunther: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over
there.

(Joey turns around and sees them kissing.)

Kathy: Oh.

Chandler: Hey Joe.

Joey: (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)

[Scene: Dr. Burke<U+0092>s office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.]

Doctor: I<U+0092>ll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.

Monica: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?

Rachel: Ooh, so cute, that I<U+0092>m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.

(The intercom buzzes.)

Nurse: Dr. Burke will see you know.

Monica: Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call
doctor will see me now.

Nurse: Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see
you now.

Dr. Timothy Burke: Ready?

(Monica looks at Rachel, who gives her the thumbs up.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.]

Chandler: Hey! I<U+0092>m sorry! That<U+0097>(sees that Joey is about to leave)
where are you going?

Joey: My folks.

Chandler: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?

Joey: I don<U+0092>t know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an
apartment.

Chandler: What?!

Joey: Yeah, y<U+0092>know at first I thought we could talk about this y<U+0092>know,
work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don<U+0092>t think I<U+0085>

Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that
I<U+0092>ll stop seeing her?

Joey: Look, it<U+0092>s not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just
reminds me of what you did. And I don<U+0092>t want to live with some one who doesn<U+0092>t
know what it is to be a friend. So, I<U+0092>ll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler
grabs his bag and stops him.)

Chandler: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!

Joey: Yeah! You did! And that<U+0092>s why I<U+0092>m leaving.

(The chick and the duck walk into the living room.)

Chandler: All right look, if you<U+0092>re not gonna stay for me, then at least
stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the
robbery and all!

Joey: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit
for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about
how I let you down! 

Chandler: What?

Joey: Yeah! But if would<U+0092>ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn
out to be, I wouldn<U+0092>t have worried about it so much! See you around!

Chandler: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be
something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in
it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?

Joey: We<U+0092>ve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Dr. Burke<U+0092>s office, Tim is examining Monica.]

Tim: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were
just standing outside The Dairy Queen.

Monica: I was probably waiting for it to open.

Tim: I gotta tell you, you look great now.

Monica: You look great too.

Tim: You<U+0092>re an excellent patient!

Monica: So how does it look?

Tim: Well, you<U+0092>ve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to
wear a patch for a couple of days.

Monica: Like a pirate?!

Tim: If that helps you. 

Monica: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her)
Come on, one of us had to mention him.

Tim: I moved back here a couple of months ago.

Monica: Oh. Big family dinner tonight?

Tim: Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)

Monica: No way!

Tim: I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriend<U+0092>s.

Monica: (disappointed) Oh.

Tim: But we broke up.

Monica: (happy) Oh. 

Tim: She-she wasn<U+0092>t ready for a serious commitment.

Monica: (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirate<U+0092>s voice) So you made her walk the
plank? Aye, matie?

Tim: You<U+0092>re not wearing the patch yet.

Monica: I know.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, It<U+0092>s closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone
that Tim is coming to dinner.]

Ross: He<U+0092>s coming here for Thanksgiving!

Rachel: I know, it<U+0092>s sick.

Monica: Why is it sick?

Rachel: Because it<U+0092>s Richard<U+0092>s son! It<U+0092>s like inviting Greek
tragedy over for dinner!

Monica: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand don<U+0092>t you?

Phoebe: Yeah, I can see where I<U+0092>d be your best shot but, no. I<U+0092>m
sorry, but I think it<U+0092>s twisted.

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: (coming out of the bathroom) What<U+0092>s twisted?

Monica: Me going out with Richard<U+0092>s son.

Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!

Chandler: (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad
idea to me.

Rachel: Is he okay in there?

Joey: He<U+0092>s fine!

Ross: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richard<U+0092>s son,
you<U+0092>d be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.

Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian,
(points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice
dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girl<U+0092>s wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler)
livin<U+0092> in a box!! (goes to her room)

Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?

Joey: Chandler?

Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through
the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another
finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a
third finger), it hurts!

Ross: (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last
year? Can I see it?

Rachel: (worried) Why?

Ross: I just wanna check something.

Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)

Ross: (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, we<U+0092>ll
see.

Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)

Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I
wear it all the time.

Ross: (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is
silver.

Rachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed. 

Ross: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!

Rachel: Well isn<U+0092>t it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy
and that I can get a lot of use out of?

Ross: What did you get?

Rachel: Credit. 

(There<U+0092>s a knock on the door.)

Monica: (running in from her bedroom) I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it!
I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it!
I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it!
I<U+0092>ll get it! I<U+0092>ll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.

Tim: Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)

Monica: Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe. 

Tim: Hi, nice to meet you.

Monica: And Joey.

Joey: Hey!

Tim: Hi, Joey.

Monica: My brother, Ross.

Ross: Hey.

Monica: And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And that<U+0092>s Chandler.

Chandler: How do ya do.

Tim: What<U+0092>s<U+0085>

Monica: Umm, well, he<U+0092>s<U+0085>

Joey: He<U+0092>s doin<U+0092> some thinkin<U+0092>!

[cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all
cheer loudly.]

Chandler: What happened? What happened?!

Joey: You kissed my girlfriend!

(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)

Rachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

Ross: Like <U+0091>em, like <U+0091>em? Or, I<U+0092>d like to get store credit for
that amount like <U+0091>em?

Rachel: (Swears in Italian, it<U+0092>s the same term used by Joey earlier and
Joey nods his approval.)

Monica: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!

Tim: Where can I wash up?

Monica: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink,
and umm, you can use the fancy soap.

Tim: Thank you.

Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savin<U+0092> that for the Pope!

Monica: See he<U+0092>s nice. Right?

Phoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you
can actually use the phrase, "That<U+0092>s not how your dad used to do it."

Tim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?

Monica: I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)

Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.

(There<U+0092>s a loud knocking.)

Phoebe: Oh, I<U+0092>ll get it. (goes over to the door.)

Chandler: Gotcha! (laughs)

Joey: That doesn<U+0092>t sound like thinking to me!

Chandler: Sorry!

Joey: Y<U+0092>know I don<U+0092>t think you should be talking at all in there! I
think you<U+0092>ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!

Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!

Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?

Ross: Sure! Oh, and Joey<U+0092>s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange
them.

Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!

Monica: Oh-ho-ho, we<U+0092>ve got company.

Ross: There<U+0092>s nothing the matter with me. See, I<U+0092>m not completely
devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.

Rachel: Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)

(an awkward silence follows)

Chandler: You can<U+0092>t tell, but I<U+0092>m trying to break the tension by
mooning you guys!

Joey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it,
all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn<U+0092>t mean anything to you, then
you should get out of there, otherwise you<U+0092>re just an idiot in a box!

Chandler: You<U+0092>re right, and I<U+0092>m sorry! This means a lot to me! I want
you to be my friend again! I swear, I won<U+0092>t say another word tonight.

Joey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?

Chandler: Absolutely!

Joey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously?
(There<U+0092>s no response from Chandler.) Okay.

(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)

Rachel: Don<U+0092>t say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross
what<U+0092>s in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell
from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the
museum from the first time we<U+0085> were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes,
but I keep the things that matter! 

Ross: I don<U+0092>t know what to say, I<U+0092>m sorry. Though, you<U+0092>re not
supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) It<U+0092>s like a million years old, we, we
actually, we had people looking for that.

(Rachel glares at him.)

[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]

Monica: (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)

Tim: Here, let me help. (Does so.)

Monica: Thank you.

Tim: You-you have a very beautiful<U+0085> eye.

Monica: Y<U+0092>know all my friends think this is weird. 

Tim: Y<U+0092>know I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and
canceled, but it really isn<U+0092>t.

Monica: I know! I mean it<U+0092>s like me and your dad, that<U+0092>s a totally
separate thing.

Tim: Oh, I totally agree.

Monica: We<U+0092>re just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?

(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls
away.)

Tim: What?

Monica: Nothing. Nothing.

Tim: No-no really, was-was that not okay?

Monica: No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kiss<U+0085>

Tim: Oh my God! It didn<U+0092>t remind you of<U+0085>

Monica: (interrupting) Don<U+0092>t say it!

Tim: No, but it did! Didn<U+0092>t it?!

Monica: Yeah!

Tim: Oh man!!

Monica: I know!

(They both shiver in horror.)

[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. There<U+0092>s a knock on the
door.]

Joey: I<U+0092>ll get it. (It<U+0092>s Kathy.)

Kathy: (sees it<U+0092>s Joey) Oh.

Joey: Hey.

Kathy: Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I am<U+0085>

Joey: That<U+0092>s okay. Chandler<U+0092>s the one I<U+0092>m mad at.

Kathy: Well, I<U+0092>m still sorry. Is he here?

Joey: In the box.

Kathy: (going over to the box) Chandler?

Phoebe: Oh, he-he can<U+0092>t talk right now.

Kathy: Why not? What<U+0092>s going on?

Phoebe: He<U+0092>s just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.

Kathy: By being in a box?

Rachel: Joey, had reasons. 

Phoebe: They were threefold.

Kathy: Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make
this easier. Listen umm<U+0085> (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint
and leave them alone.) Listen I don<U+0092>t wanna be someone who comes between two best
friends. I just, I can<U+0092>t stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I
don<U+0092>t wanna be the cause of that. So, I don<U+0092>t think we can see each other
anymore. I<U+0092>m gonna go to my mom<U+0092>s in Chicago, I<U+0092>m gonna stay there for
awhile. I think this could<U+0092>ve be something really amazing, but y<U+0092>know this is
probably for the best. Y<U+0092>know? I<U+0092>m gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler. 

(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the
air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)

Joey: (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)

Rachel: What?!

Joey: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get
out of there!

Chandler: So?

Joey: Yeah, we<U+0092>re gonna be fine! Get out!

Chandler: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah, you did some real good thinkin<U+0092> in there.

Chandler: Man, this is<U+0085> 

(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)

Joey: Now go! <U+0091>Cause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from
you<U+0092>re secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.) 

(After he<U+0092>s gone.) 

Joey: All right, who got Chandler? <U+0091>Cause I uh, need to trade.

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's Balcony, the gang is all there watching Chandler.]

Rachel: Oh, he sees her!

Monica: Oh, he<U+0092>s catching up to her!

Phoebe: Oh, she sees him! Oh, they<U+0092>re hugging!

Ross: He<U+0092>s taking her purse!

Joey: Uhh, that<U+0092>s not them. I<U+0092>m gonna go call the police.

Phoebe: Oh, there they are!

(They watch them making up and sigh)

Phoebe: All right, get a room.
