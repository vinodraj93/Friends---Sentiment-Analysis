Transcribed by: Eric Aasen

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are getting ready to go on their
honeymoon. Monica is entering from the bedroom.]

Chandler: Hey! Babe! Aren<U+0092>t you excited we<U+0092>re going on our honeymoon?

Monica: Yeah I am!

Chandler: (singing) Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama<U+0085>

Monica: That<U+0092>s right. Get it out of your system while we<U+0092>re alone.

Joey: (entering with Phoebe) Hey!

Phoebe: Yeah! Have a great honeymoon!

Chandler: I<U+0092>d better go pack.

Monica: Oh no, I already packed. The only thing I couldn<U+0092>t find though was
your Speedo.

(Joey looks at him, Phoebe tries not to smile, and Chandler is shocked.)

Chandler: A Speedo? Uh, I don<U+0092>t have a Speedo. I<U+0092>m gonna go pack my
regular long bathing suit. (Goes into the bedroom.)

Rachel: (entering) Oh good you<U+0092>re still here!

Monica: Hey!

Rachel: I want to tell you to have a good honeymoon! (Hugs Monica.)

Monica: Thank you.

Rachel: And I also wanted you guys to know that I am telling the father today.
(They all look at her expectantly) What? What? What?

(Pause.)

Joey: We know its Ross!

Rachel: How?! How do you know?

Phoebe: It was his sweater, but<U+0097>Oh my God!

Rachel: Oh, I so wanted Ross to know first, but I<U+0092>m so relieved you guys
know.

Monica: This is so great! And I<U+0092>m gonna be your baby<U+0092>s aunt!

Rachel: I know! (They hug.)

Phoebe: Me too! (Joins the hug.)

Joey: I<U+0092>m gonna be an uncle! Come here! (He joins the hug.)

Rachel: (breaking the hug) You<U+0092>re all gonna be aunts and uncles.

Monica: Yeah, but I<U+0092>m the only one related by blood.

Rachel: Okay. Great! So now that you guys all know you can help me. Give me some
advice on how I<U+0092>m gonna tell Ross!

Monica: Well, what were you gonna say?

Rachel: Well I was gonna tell him that I<U+0092>m-I<U+0092>m gonna have the baby and
he can be as involved as he wants.

Joey: Well that, that sounds good.

Rachel: Yeah but how do I start? I mean, what<U+0092>s-what<U+0092>s the first thing
that I say? (They all pause to think.) Okay great! Thanks. (She starts to leave.)

Monica: Hey! Good luck!

Phoebe: Yeah, bye.

Joey: Bye.

(Rachel exits.)

Chandler: (entering) Hey, what was that all about?

Monica: Well I guess there is no harm in telling you now, Rachel and Ross are
gonna have a baby.

Chandler: (in a high pitched voice) What?! I didn<U+0092>t even know that<U+0097>Why
didn<U+0092>t you tell me?! (Pause) Why am I talking like this?!

Monica: I didn<U+0092>t think you could keep it a secret.

Chandler: (in the high pitched voice) What?! (Normal voice) I am an excellent
secret keeper. I have kept all of our secrets.

Joey: What secrets?

Chandler: Oh no-no Joey, I am not going to tell you because I am an excellent
secret keeper.

(The girls walk away.)

Joey: (whispering to Chandler) You<U+0092>ll tell me later?

Chandler: You already know.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are entering.]

Phoebe: Oh, it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.

Joey: Y<U+0092>know, Monica and Chandler are married. Ross and Rachel are having a
baby. Maybe you and I should do something.

Phoebe: All in good time my love. All in good time. Oh shoot! I left my guitar
in their apartment. Well you can let me in later.

Joey: I don<U+0092>t have a key, they took mine to give to you.

Phoebe: What?! They took mine to give to you!

Joey: Why would they take away our keys?

Phoebe: Maybe they don<U+0092>t trust us.

Joey: No that<U+0092>s not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out
of town. 

Phoebe: You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with
Monica<U+0092>s guest towels?

Joey: Hey, I washed those!

Phoebe: No you didn<U+0092>t.

Joey: Yeah that didn<U+0092>t sound like me.

Phoebe: Well, what am I gonna do? I really need my guitar!

Joey: Yeah, I have stuff in there too.

Phoebe: What stuff?

Joey: Monica<U+0092>s chicken parm! I<U+0092>ll take care of it. (He picks up the
phone) Hey Mr. Treeger, it<U+0092>s Joey Tribbiani. Listen, I need to get into Monica and
Chandler<U+0092>s apartment. It<U+0092>s an emergency. (Listens) Uhh, gas leak! Yeah oh, and
bring garlic bread. (Hangs up.)

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Did Rachel find you?

Ross: No why?

Phoebe: Oh she was looking for you.

Ross: Oh well, I guess I<U+0092>ll catch up with her later.

Phoebe: Well, she really wanted to talk to you now.

Joey: Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

Ross: Oh no.

Phoebe: What?

Ross: I think I might know what this is about.

(Phoebe and Joey trade looks)

Joey: Really?

Ross: Yeah. Uh, uh we promised we weren<U+0092>t gonna tell anybody this but uh,
about a month ago Rachel and I slept together.

Phoebe: (deadpan) And?

Ross: Wow! I thought you would be a little more shocked.

Phoebe: Oh sorry. (Shocked) And?!

Ross: Well, we-we said we<U+0092>d just do it that one time but, but now I think
she may wanna start things up again.

Joey: Yeah, I don<U+0092>t think that<U+0092>s what it is.

Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?

Joey: Oh wow, I don<U+0092>t feel well.

Ross: I<U+0092>m telling you. I<U+0092>m telling you. That<U+0092>s what it is. No
wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didn<U+0092>t say anything to
you?

Phoebe: (To Joey) Maybe it<U+0092>s something you ate?

Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.

Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, y<U+0092>know what I have to
realize? Maybe I<U+0092>m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with.
Y<U+0092>know, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He
pauses and then exits.)

[Scene: The Airport Ticket Counter, Monica and Chandler are standing in line behind
another couple kissing who are next in line to be served.]

Ticket Agent: Next?

(The kissing couple doesn<U+0092>t move.)

Monica: They<U+0092>re kissing let<U+0092>s just go around them.

Chandler: Oh honey, leave them alone, they<U+0092>re in love.

Monica: I<U+0092>m in love too! But in an orderly fashion.

Ticket Agent: Next?

Monica: (to the couple) Hi! Can you do that and walk? <U+0091>Cause she
said, "Next."

(The couple moves up to the counter.)

Woman: Sorry. We didn<U+0092>t hear you; we<U+0092>re on our honeymoon.

Ticket Agent: Oh, let me see what I can do. (Checks the computer) There are some
first class seats available.

Monica: (To Chandler) Did you hear that?! They bumped them up to first class
because they are on their honeymoon! Come on! Let<U+0092>s act like we<U+0092>re on our
honeymoon.

Chandler: We are on our honeymoon.

Monica: Grab my ass!

Ticket Agent: Next?

(They go up to the counter.)

Monica: Hi, sorry. I almost didn<U+0092>t hear you, because y<U+0092>know I<U+0092>m
just so in love with my new husband. We<U+0092>re on our honeymoon.

Ticket Agent: Congratulations. Okay, Mr. Bing you<U+0092>ll be in 25J and Mrs.
Bing you<U+0092>ll be in 25K.

Monica: Oh no, you see we<U+0092>re on our honeymoon. So umm, can you do your
little thing and bump us up to first class?

Ticket Agent: I<U+0092>m sorry, all our first class seats are taken. That couple
got the last two.

Monica: You see, if we<U+0092>d gone around them like I said, we<U+0097>She
would<U+0092>ve given us those tickets. Damnit!

Chandler: 25J and K, any chance those aren<U+0092>t together?

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Joey are playing Rock <U+0091>em, Sock <U+0091>em
Robots.]

Joey: I still can<U+0092>t believe they took away my key. You trust me with yours.

Phoebe: Of course I do! And I<U+0092>m gonna give it back to you as soon as
they<U+0092>re done with it at the key shining place.

(They hear a knocking sound coming from the hallway and go to investigate.)

Joey: What the hell is that?

(They go into the hallway and see Mr. Treeger watching one of New York<U+0092>s bravest
breakdown Monica and Chandler<U+0092>s door with an ax.]

Joey: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Treeger, what are you doing?

Mr. Treeger: You said there was a gas leak in here.

Phoebe: Well why don<U+0092>t you use your key?

Mr. Treeger: Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key
ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at
another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman)
Come on! Hurry up.

(With a final swing the door gives way.)

Phoebe: Oh! We could have done that.

[Scene: The Airport, Chandler and Monica are following the previous couple through a
tiny hallway that proves this is a set on a sound stage and not an actual airport, and see
them enter the first class lounge.]

Monica: Look at that! Look at that! They<U+0092>re going into the first class
lounge! Do you know what they have in there?

Chandler: No.

Monica: Me neither! We have to get in! (She runs through the door with Chandler
in tow.)

Chandler: Just act like you belong.

Monica: Oh my God! Oranges!

Chandler: Shh! (To the guy behind the counter) Nice to see you again. (They
tries to walk past him.)

Airline Employee: Uh sir, may I see your tickets please?

Chandler: Yes, of course. (Shows him the tickets.)

Airline Employee: I<U+0092>m sorry, would you move your thumb? I can<U+0092>t see
the seat number.

Chandler: Oh that<U+0092>s all right, I have it memorized. It<U+0092>s 1A.

Airline Employee: (grabbing the ticket from him) Sir, this is not a first class
ticket. I<U+0092>m sorry.

Chandler: Apology accepted. Excuse us. (They try to enter again.)

Airline Employee: Sir! I<U+0092>m afraid I<U+0092>m gonna have to ask you to leave.

Monica: Fine. (Starts to walk away then she runs over and grabs an orange before
she exits.) Go! Go! Go!

[Scene: The Hallway Outside Ross<U+0092>s Apartment, Ross is walking towards his
apartment and sees Rachel sitting in front of the door.]

Rachel: (seeing him) Hi!

Ross: Hi.

Rachel: Hi. (He helps her up.) Umm, I think there<U+0092>s something that we
really need to talk about.

Ross: (quietly confident) I think we do. Why don<U+0092>t we go inside? (They go
inside.) Look uh, I know why you<U+0092>re here.

Rachel: You do?

Ross: Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should
talk first.

Rachel: (warily) Okay.

Ross: Okay. (He sits her down in a chair.) Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross.
That<U+0092>s been one heck of a see-saw hasn<U+0092>t it?

Rachel: (confused) What?

Ross: I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun and<U+0085>and certainly
passionate, but don<U+0092>t you think it<U+0092>s better if we just stayed friends?

Rachel: Seriously. What?!

Ross: Okay. Okay. Y<U+0092>know what? If you want to, we can do it one more time.
I mean I<U+0092>d-I<U+0092>d be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.

Rachel: Okay, y<U+0092>know what? Can I, can I talk now?

Ross: Oh sure. (He sits on the apothecary table and touches her hand.)

Rachel: (touches his knee) I<U+0092>m pregnant. (Ross stops.) Ross? (Ross is
staring off into space.) Ross? (Ross is still frozen) Okay, whenever you<U+0092>re ready.
(Sits back and opens her magazine.) And you<U+0092>re the father by the way<U+0097>but you got
that<U+0085>

Commercial Break

[Scene: Ross's Apartment, continued from earlier.]

Rachel: (closes her magazine) Can I get you some water?

Ross: I<U+0092>m good. I<U+0092>m good.

Rachel: Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay? I mean you can as involved as
you want. (Ross nods.)

Ross: Yeah, I need uh<U+0085> I<U+0092>m just<U+0097>I don<U+0092>t know<U+0097>I
don<U+0092>t understand, umm, how this happened? We-we used a condom.

Rachel: I know. I know, but y<U+0092>know condoms only work like 97% of the time.

Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!

Rachel: They do!

Ross: No they don<U+0092>t!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with
his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!

Rachel: Okay Ross come on let<U+0092>s just forget about the condoms.

Ross: Oh well I may as well have!

Rachel: Listen, y<U+0092>know what? I was really freaked out too when I found
out<U+0085>

Ross: Freaked out? Hey no, I<U+0092>m not freaked out! I<U+0092>m indignant!
As a consumer!

Rachel: Y<U+0092>know what? Let<U+0092>s, let<U+0092>s talk later.

Ross: No! No! I want to talk now! Okay? I<U+0097>In fact, (picks up the phone) I
am going to talk to the president of the condom company!

Rachel: Okay, y<U+0092>know maybe I should come back<U+0085> (Starts to leave.)

Ross: (grabs her) Shh! Shh! Shh!

Rachel: (stops) Okay.

Ross: (on phone) Yeah I<U+0092>ll press 1! (Presses one which allows Rachel to
escape.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Mr. Treeger has finished inspecting Monica and
Chandler<U+0092>s apartment.]

Mr. Treeger: I<U+0092>ve looked everywhere. There<U+0092>s no gas leak.

Joey: (eating) Huh. So then I can heat this up? (Goes and does so.)

Mr. Treeger: Anyway uh, I<U+0092>ll get moving on that new door.

Phoebe: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and
Monica about this? <U+0091>Cause y<U+0092>know umm, they don<U+0092>t-they don<U+0092>t have any
kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.

Mr. Treeger: Well I<U+0092>m gonna have to put on a new lock, they<U+0092>ll find
out anyway.

Phoebe: Oh no.

Mr. Treeger: (measures the top of the doorframe) Whoa! This looks like an all
day job, I<U+0092>ll have to cancel my yoga class. (Ross walks up.) Hey Ross!

Ross: Hi.

Mr. Treeger: Could you tell Jasmine that I won't make it to yoga class today?

Ross: Sure.

Mr. Treeger: Namaste. (Bows.)

Ross: Namaste. (Bows.)

(Treeger leaves and Ross notices the door.)

Ross: Oh my God! What happened to the door?!

Joey: So it<U+0092>s noticeable huh?

Ross: Look, is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.

Phoebe: Didn<U+0092>t you two already talk?

Ross: Yeah but uh<U+0085> Okay, okay look you guys know that Rachel and I slept
together, but there<U+0092>s something else. (Pause) Rachel<U+0092>s pregnant.

Joey: (simultaneously) Oh my God!!! I can<U+0092>t believe that!!

Phoebe: (simultaneously) Holy mother of God!!!

Ross: With my child.

Phoebe: That is brand new information!!

Ross: You already know don<U+0092>t you?

Phoebe: A little bit.

Joey: How are you doing?

Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean I<U+0092>ll be okay. It<U+0092>s just I don<U+0092>t think I
handled it very well.

Joey: Well, what did you say to her?

Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.
And then when I turned around she was gone.

Phoebe: Oh Ross.

Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97%
effective.

Joey: (shocked) What?

Ross: I gotta go find her.

Joey: Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they
don<U+0092>t even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!

Ross: Evidently they do.

Joey: What?! (Grabs his condoms from his pocket and looks.)

[Scene: The Atlantis Resort, Chandler and Monica are arriving to check in, but are
behind the couple from before again.]

Monica: I can<U+0092>t believe we<U+0092>re here.

Chandler: Oh you<U+0092>ve got to be kidding me.

Monica: What? (Monica sees the first couple and gasps.)

Front Desk Clerk: As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the
honeymoon suite.

Monica: No!! You have been screwing us all day!

Man: Who are you?

Chandler: We<U+0092>re you just ten seconds later!

Monica: Yeah! You already got the first class tickets; you got the lounge! I
mean we should get free stuff too! I mean you<U+0092>re not the only ones on your honeymoon!

Woman: Well you can have the suite if you want. We don<U+0092>t care about where
we stay. We<U+0092>re here to celebrate our love together. We don<U+0092>t have to get free
stuff. We just want to be together.

Chandler: (looks at Monica then at them) We need the stuff.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Joey is on the phone and Phoebe is watching him.]

Joey: Hey Monica it<U+0092>s Joey. Listen uh, Phoebe and I smell gas comin<U+0092>
from your apartment.

Monica: What? Are you serious?! (To Chandler) Joey smells gas!

Chandler: What else is new?

Joey: Yeah and we<U+0092>d go check it out, but you took away our keys.

Monica: Well do something! Get in there!

Joey: How? I guess I could break down your door.

Monica: Yeah! Do that!

Joey: And-and you won<U+0092>t blame us for any damage? (Gives Phoebe a thumbs
up.)

Monica: No! (Pause) Are you doing it?! I don<U+0092>t hear anything! Come on!

Joey: Uh, okay I<U+0092>ll-I<U+0092>ll-I<U+0092>ll break it down. (He hands the phone
to Phoebe, gets up, picks up a chair, and starts banging it on the floor.)

Phoebe: Oh hey hi, he<U+0092>s doing it. He<U+0092>s breaking down the door. (The
chair breaks in half.) Okay, we<U+0092>re in. (She hangs up the phone.)

[Scene: A doctor<U+0092>s office, Rachel is on an examining table with her legs in the
stirrups.]

Nurse: Okay Rachel, are you comfortable?

Rachel: (sighs) If I said I was, would you judge me?

Nurse: The doctor will be here in a minute to do your sonogram.

Rachel: Okay. (The nurse exits.) Oh man, I swear if they sold these at Pottery
Barn<U+0085>

(There<U+0092>s a knock on the door and Ross enters.)

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: (shocked) Hi!

Ross: Uh we-we need to talk.

Rachel: Uh-uh-uh, right now? Because I<U+0092>ve kinda got an el fresco situation
going on over here.

Ross: Please, please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today.

Rachel: Okay Ross that<U+0092>s fine, but can you please stand near my head?

Ross: What? Oh yeah. (He moves next to her head.) I<U+0092>m sorry. I mean I-I
think I went a little crazy. I mean I was thinking about myself when I (Wanders towards
Rachel<U+0092>s feet) really<U+0097>I should have been thinking about you Rach<U+0085>

Rachel: Okay. Head Ross! Head Ross! Head Ross!

Ross: Right! Right! I just<U+0097>I want you to know that I<U+0092>m going to be
there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctor<U+0092>s appointments, the uh, the
Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartment<U+0097>Although we could probably worry about
that <U+0091>til after we get married.

Rachel: What married?

Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.

Rachel: What, because that<U+0092>s your answer to everything?

Ross: No, because that<U+0092>s the right thing to do.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you<U+0092>re in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are
we?

Ross: No but<U+0085>but still you can<U+0092>t possibly do this alone.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Ross: Come on Rach, you can<U+0092>t even eat alone in a restaurant.

Rachel: What?!

Ross: I<U+0092>m just saying if you can<U+0092>t eat by yourself, how do you expect
to have a baby by yourself?

Rachel: I can too eat by myself!

Ross: When have you ever?

Rachel: When certain people leave the table and I am not finished!

Ross: Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup!

Rachel: Oh please, you inhale your food!

Ross: I grew up with Monica! If you didn<U+0092>t eat fast you didn<U+0092>t eat!!

Dr. Long: (entering) Am I interrupting?

Rachel: Oh no Dr. Long, please come in. This is Ross, he is the father.

Ross: But not the husband, because evidently she can do this alone.

Dr. Long: Huh. Nice to meet you. I<U+0092>ll get started on this.

Ross: (To Rachel, standing by her feet) I don<U+0092>t know why you can<U+0092>t
admit that you need me.

Rachel: I do need you! I need you to stand near my head!

Dr. Long: Okay, everything looks good. Here it is on the screen. (We see Ross
and Rachel looking at the screen.) Here is your uterus. And right here is your baby.

Ross: Oh my God.

Rachel: Wow. There it is, I see it.

Dr. Long: Congratulations. I<U+0092>ll give you two a minute.

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: Thank you.

(Dr. Long exits and Rachel starts to cry.)

Ross: Pretty amazing huh?

Rachel: I don<U+0092>t see it!

Ross: What? What?!

Rachel: I can<U+0092>t see it!

Ross: You-you just said that you did!

Rachel: I know, I lied! I didn<U+0092>t want her to think I was a terrible mother!
I can<U+0092>t even see my own baby!

Ross: Oh sure, come here! (Sits her up) Sure you can! Uh, look come here look,
(rolls the machine closer) it<U+0092>s-it<U+0092>s-it<U+0092>s, it<U+0092>s right there (Points).

Rachel: Oh. Oh, it<U+0092>s beautiful. I see it now.

Ross: Do you really?

Rachel: No, I don<U+0092>t see it!

Ross: Come on! Come on! Here, okay-okay, you see this? (Points) This tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Sweetie that<U+0092>s it.

Rachel: That<U+0092>s it? Well I saw that! Ohh-ohh-oh, thank you.

Ross: You<U+0092>re welcome.

Rachel: Wow! I can<U+0092>t believe that<U+0092>s our baby.

Ross: Yeah, that<U+0092>s our baby.

Closing Credits

doctor<U+0092>s appointment.]

Rachel: Hi.

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey! So how was the doctor?

Rachel: Oh, everything went great.

Phoebe: Good.

Ross: Oh hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

(She does so.)

Phoebe: Oh.

Joey: I don<U+0092>t see the baby. Where is it?

Rachel: Oh no, I know I couldn<U+0092>t see it either at first, but it<U+0092>s

Ross: Oh. (He takes the picture and hugs her.
