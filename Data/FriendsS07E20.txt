[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch and Ross is
sitting on the chair, and they<U+0092>re all talking.] 

Rachel: Hey! Out of all of us, who do you think is gonna get married next?

Joey: Probably Monica and Chandler.

(A woman walks up to Gunther in the background.)

Woman: (to Gunther) Hi. Could I have a pack of Newport Lights,
please?

Gunther: Oh umm, uh we don<U+0092>t sell cigarettes, but they have them at the
newsstand across the street. (Points.)

Woman: That<U+0092>d be great, thanks. (Gunther goes and gets them.)

Rachel: (to the gang) Oh my God, Melissa Warburton. I don<U+0092>t think I have
the energy for this.

Melissa: (Gasps when she notices Rachel) Oh my God! Ray-ray Green?! (Screams)

Rachel: (screaming) Melissa!

Melissa: You have been M.I.A for the past seven sorority newsletters,
what<U+0092>s up with you?!

Rachel: Wh<U+0097>(Turns and looks at the gang who<U+0092>s staring)<U+0097>Why
don<U+0092>t I tell you over here? (She walks Melissa away from the gang.)

Melissa: So last I heard you were gonna get married. (Grabs Rachel<U+0092>s hand
and notices that she doesn<U+0092>t have a ring on it.) (Sadly) Oh poor Ray-ray.

Rachel: Oh no-no, no! It<U+0092>s good! It<U+0092>s all good! I-I actually work at Ralph
Lauren!

Melissa: Shut up!

Rachel: I will not! I<U+0092>m the divisional head of men<U+0092>s sportswear!

Melissa: Oh shut up more! Now, are you friends with Ralph?

Rachel: Oh please<U+0085>

Melissa: (excitedly) Are you?!

Rachel: No.

Melissa: Listen, we-we have to have dinner. What-what are you doing tomorrow
night?

Rachel: Oh tomorrow, oh I don<U+0092>t know. Um<U+0085>

Melissa: You do now. You<U+0092>re having dinner with me.

Rachel: Shut up.

Melissa: I-I<U+0092>ve got to go. This has been so great Ray-ray! (Gunther returns
with her cigarettes.) Oh, there you are. (Takes them from Gunther.) (To Rachel) Umm, so
listen, just call me. Here<U+0092>s my card. (Hands the card over.)

Rachel: Oh, wow thanks! (Reading the card) Oh you<U+0092>re in real estate!

Melissa: Oh no, that<U+0092>s-that<U+0092>s an old card. Umm, I wanted to get out of
that and-and do something where I can really help people and-and make a difference.

Rachel: Wow! What do you do now?

Melissa: (quietly) I<U+0092>m a party planner. I<U+0092>ll see you tomorrow.
(Exits.)

Rachel: Okay! (Joins the rest of the gang.)

Joey: Hey guys! Look who<U+0092>s back! It<U+0092>s Ray-ray!

Rachel: Shut up that was my friend Melissa from college.

Ross: She seems really, really fun!

Rachel: She<U+0092>s actually very sweet and we used to be very close.

Monica: Wait a minute, she isn<U+0092>t<U+0085> She<U+0092>s not the one who you<U+0085>

Joey: (excitedly) Who you what? Who you what?!

Rachel: (To Monica) Yes.

Monica: Wow!

Joey: (excitedly) Wow? Wow what?! Wow what?! Who you<U+0097>what?!!

Rachel: It<U+0092>s not a big deal!

Monica: (To Joey) They were lovers.

Ross: What?!

Joey: What?!

Rachel: No we weren<U+0092>t! It was nothing! It was one night, senior year we
went to a party, had a lot of sangria and y<U+0092>know, ended up<U+0085>kissing for a
bit.

Ross: So that<U+0092>s two of my wives.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is working on the seating chart while Chandler
looks on and Rachel reads.]

Monica: (telling Chandler the seating arrangement) Okay so this is where the
band is. (Points.) And this is where the bar is. (Points) And all these pins have
people<U+0092>s names on them. (She has pins to show the seating at each of the tables.) And
Rach, here you are. (Points to Rachel<U+0092>s place.)

Rachel: Oh wow. Why don<U+0092>t we just take me (Grabs her pin) and put me with a
Manhattan in my hand, talking to the cute bartender. (Puts her pin at the bar and laughs.
Monica just glares at her.) These pins aren<U+0092>t for playing are they?

Monica: (To Chandler) Okay, the red ones are my guests and the blue ones are
yours.

Chandler: This is so sad. I mean, I only have like ten pins.

Monica: Chandler, relax it<U+0092>s not a contest. (To Rachel) Certainly not a
close one.

Joey: (entering) Hello!

Rachel: Hey!

Joey: Hey Rach. (Stares at her.) 

Rachel: Stop picturing it!!

Monica: Okay, I think that<U+0092>s it. The seating chart is done. This is our
wedding. They all look like they<U+0092>re having fun don<U+0092>t they?

Joey: Hey, so where are my parents gonna be?

Monica: Oh! (Gets up) Let<U+0092>s see, well<U+0085>if this is the wedding hall then
umm (Walks away) you<U+0092>re parents will be at home in Queens.

Joey: What they<U+0092>re not invited?! Oh no, that<U+0092>s terrible! They<U+0092>re
gonna be crushed!

Monica: Why would they think they<U+0092>re invited?

Joey: (looking around) You got me. I don<U+0092>t<U+0085>

Monica: Joey!

Joey: Well, I<U+0092>m sorry. I thought parents were coming! Y<U+0092>know? Your
parents are comin<U+0092>! Chandler<U+0092>s parents are comin<U+0092>! Ross<U+0092>s parents are
comin<U+0092>!

Monica: Ross<U+0092>s parents are my parents!

Joey: Well-well<U+0097>see? Parents are comin<U+0092>!

Chandler: Y<U+0092>know I think we should invite them.

Monica: Oh please, you just want more blue pins.

Chandler: Well this is just sad!

Monica: All right, all right. Maybe I can fit them in if I just do some
rearranging. But uh, Rachel may actually have to sit at the bar!

Rachel: That is not a problem.

Joey: (leaning down to her) Maybe you<U+0092>ll order a little sangria?

Rachel: Oh, get out of here! (Jumps back and walks away.)

[Scene: Ralph Lauren, Rachel is showing Chandler the selection of tuxedos.]

Rachel: (motioning to a rack) So now, these are all the tuxedos that we make and
if there<U+0092>s anything that you like, we can make you a deal. Anything at all. (Grabs a
few) But these are the three that Monica pre-approved.

Chandler: Well, thanks a lot for hookin<U+0092> me up Rach. I want you to know
that I want you to attend our wedding as my guest.

Rachel: I<U+0092>m Monica<U+0092>s maid of honor. Okay? Don<U+0092>t try to blue pin
me!

Chandler: (sees another rack) Well, what<U+0092>s the deal with these? These-these
look nice.

Rachel: Oh they are nice. We-we custom-make tuxedos for celebrities and then
when they<U+0092>re done with them they just send <U+0091>em back.

Chandler: You mean like for award shows?

Rachel: Some of them.

Chandler: You mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people
yelling, "You are you wearing?! You look fabulous!"

Rachel: Honey, might I suggest watching a little more ESPN and a little
less E!?

Chandler: Okay, who wore those? (Points to the tuxedos.)

Rachel: Umm, well let<U+0092>s see uh, this one is Tom Brokaw.

Chandler: Not bad.

Rachel: (reading a tag) This one is uh Paul O<U+0092>Neil.

Chandler: Who<U+0092>s that?

Rachel: He plays for the Yankees. Seriously, ESPN! Just once and a while,
have it on in the background. (Chandler nods and Rachel grabs another tux) Ooh, this one
was Pierce Brosnan!

Chandler: Pierce Brosnan?

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Rachel: Yeah.

Chandler: 007?! This is James Bond<U+0092>s tux?!

Rachel: Yeah.

Chandler: Oh, I have to get married in James Bond<U+0092>s tux!

Rachel: It<U+0092>s a pretty cool tux.

Chandler: Oh, it<U+0092>s not just that, I would be England<U+0092>s most powerful
weapon. Jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty<U+0092>s secret service. A man who fears no
one; with a license to kill. (Worried.) Would Monica let me wear this?

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Phoebe are moving chess pieces around on the board
and hitting the timer at random.]

Joey: We should really learn how to play the real way. (Moves another piece.)

Phoebe: I like our way. Oh! (Grabs a piece and jumps a bunch of Joey<U+0092>s like
in Checkers.) Chess!

Joey: Nice move.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: So Joey I just hooked Ross and Chandler up with some tuxedos for the
wedding, do you need one?

Joey: No, I<U+0092>m performing the ceremony. I<U+0092>m not wearing a tux.

Rachel: Well, what are you going to wear?

Joey: Multi-colored robes! Ooh, and maybe a hat.

Rachel: Huh. Does Monica know about this?

Joey: I don<U+0092>t think so.

Rachel: Can I please be there when you tell her? (Joey nods yes.)

Phoebe: Hey oh, Rach wait! Do you want to go to a movie tonight?

Rachel: Oh, y<U+0092>know what? I can<U+0092>t. I have to have dinner with that
Melissa girl.

Joey: (excitedly) Can I come?! I won<U+0092>t even talk! You<U+0092>ll just hear the
noise from my video camera.

Phoebe: What is this? What<U+0092>s going on?

Joey: Oh good! Can I tell her?! Can I tell her?!

Rachel: Well, do you want to hear what actually happened or Joey<U+0092>s lewd
version?

Phoebe: Joey<U+0092>s!

Joey: Okay<U+0085>

Rachel: Hey, come on! I had this friend from college and I made the stupid
mistake of telling Joey that one time<U+0085>she and I y<U+0092>know<U+0085>kissed a little bit.

Phoebe: (laughs) Yeah, I<U+0092>m sure that happened.

Rachel: It-it did!

Phoebe: Sure!

Joey: Hey. (Laughs then seriously) It happened!

Rachel: Yeah, it was senior year in college. It was after the Sigma Chi luau and
Melissa and I got very drunk! And we ended up kissing! For several minutes! 

Phoebe: (To Joey) Which means she had a couple spritzers and a quick peck on the
cheek.

Joey: Why are you taking this away from me?

Rachel: Yeah, why is it so hard for you to believe?!

Phoebe: Okay! I just<U+0097>I didn<U+0092>t know that you are a lesbian. (Joey
smiles and nods lewdly.)

Rachel: I<U+0092>m not saying that I<U+0092>m a lesbian! I<U+0092>m just saying that
this happened!

Phoebe: Okay, it just seems pretty wild and you<U+0092>re so<U+0097>y<U+0092>know
so<U+0085>vanilla.

Rachel: (shocked) Vanilla?!

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: I<U+0092>m not vanilla! I<U+0092>ve done lots of crazy things! I mean I
got-I got drunk and married in Vegas!

Phoebe: To Ross.

Rachel: All right, y<U+0092>know what? If you don<U+0092>t want to believe me about
this, why don<U+0092>t you just come with me to dinner tonight and she will tell you.

Phoebe: Okay! All right! Yeah! <U+0091>Cause I just can<U+0092>t picture it.

Joey: Oh-ho, you should get inside my head.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is on the couch reading as Ross enters carrying a
garment bag.]

Ross: Hey! Guess what I got for your wedding! (Holding up his garment bag.)

Chandler: A freakish thin date with a hanger for her head?

Ross: No. Rachel hooked me up with a tux! But not just any tux, Batman<U+0092>s
tux!

Chandler: What?

Ross: That<U+0092>s right! Made expressly for Val Kilmer and worn by him in the
hit film<U+0085>that Batman film he was in.

Chandler: You can<U+0092>t wear that! I<U+0092>m wearing the famous tux! James
Bond<U+0092>s tux!

Ross: So?

Chandler: So<U+0097>If you wear that you<U+0092>ll make mine less special.

Ross: Well, you need something to make this day special? Hello! You-you-you have
the most special thing of all! You are marrying the woman you love.

(Chandler mimics him.)

Chandler: Please, don<U+0092>t take away my cool thing. Please?! Pretty please?!

Ross: Pretty please? Not very uh, 007.

Chandler: Look, it<U+0092>s my wedding day okay? If you were getting married I
would never do anything to upset you.

Ross: When I got married you slept with my sister.

Chandler: That was pretty 007.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still working on the seating chart as Joey
enters.]

Joey: Hey.

Monica: Hey. Oh good-good you<U+0092>re here! All right, I figured it out.
I<U+0092>m gonna take two tables of eight, I<U+0092>m gonna add your parents, and I<U+0092>m
gonna turn them into three tables of six. Okay? And I called the caterer; I added two
extra meals, we are good to go!

Joey: Yeah, they<U+0092>re not coming.

Monica: (looking at him) What?!

Joey: Somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me.
They<U+0085>feel a little unwanted.

Monica: Oh that<U+0092>s too bad. It<U+0092>s true, but too bad.

Joey: Look Mon, if you could just call my mom<U+0085>

Monica: Oh Joey!

Joey: Come on! Look just-just tell<U+0097>let her know that you really want them
to be there. Let<U+0092>s not forget, this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over
the years.

Monica: No she hasn<U+0092>t.

Joey: Is it her fault that some of them didn<U+0092>t make it to you?

Monica: Well, what am I going to say?

Joey: I don<U+0092>t know. Just uh, just tell <U+0091>em it was a mix-up with the
invitations, or<U+0097>No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post
office. And the Irish! But I don<U+0092>t think you can blame it on them so<U+0085> (He dials
the phone and hands it to Monica.)

Monica: (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? (Listens) Hi, this
is Monica Geller. (Listens) Yeah I<U+0092>m just calling to say that Chandler and I uh,
really hope you can make it to the wedding. Yeah, apparently a bunch of invitations that
we sent weren<U+0092>t delivered. Umm, I guess there was some screw up at the damn post
office! (Joey nods his approval.) (Listens) T-Tell me about it! (Listens) Yeah, yeah, the
US Post Office? No, more like US lost office! (Listens) What are they Irish?! (Joey gives
her a thumbs up.)

[Scene: A restaurant, Melissa, Rachel, and Phoebe are talking.]

Melissa: <U+0085>anyway, his name is Allan and we<U+0092>ve been going out for three
years. He was my first client when I became a party planner. He was planning a party for
his girlfriend at the time. Oh well. (Rachel and Phoebe politely laugh) And he was Theta
Beta Pi at Syracuse.

Rachel: Oh. Oh, that<U+0092>s great!

Melissa: Hmm Phoebe, were you ever in a sorority?

Phoebe: Of course! Yeah, I was uh, umm Thigh Mega Tampon.

Melissa: What one?

Phoebe: Yeah! Y<U+0092>know, we were really huge too, but then they had to shut us
down when Regina Philange died of alcohol poisoning.

Melissa: Oh, isn<U+0092>t a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?
(Phoebe agrees by grunting.)

Rachel: (changing the subject) Anyway, speaking of drinking too much. I was uh,
tellin<U+0092> Phoebe about that one crazy night after the Sigma Chi luau where you and I
uh, we made out.

Melissa: (shocked) What?

Rachel: Remember?! We<U+0097>come on both had the sarongs on, and we had the-the
coconut bikini tops<U+0085>

Melissa: Yeah?

Rachel: <U+0085>we went back the house and we got really silly and we<U+0085>we made
out.

Melissa: Oh wow, Ray-ray I have no idea what you<U+0092>re talking about.

Phoebe: Really?!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is on the couch as Chandler disgustedly enters.]

Chandler: Ross is Batman!

Monica: Well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.

Chandler: Rachel got Ross the tuxedo that Val Kilmer wore in Batman. Okay Batman
is so much cooler than James Bond!

Monica: What are you talking about?! 007 has all those gadgets!

Chandler: Batman has a utility belt!

Monica: 007 has a fancy car!

Chandler: Batman has the Batmobile!

Monica: 007 gets all the ladies.

Chandler: Batman has Robin! (Pause) We get ESPN right?

Monica: How about you go put on your 007 tuxedo and I<U+0092>ll make you a nice
martini.

Chandler: Actually, I don<U+0092>t like martinis.

Monica: How about a Youhoo with a funny straw?

Chandler: Ooh, yum! (Runs into the bedroom.)

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Monica: Hey.

Joey: Listen, I know the invitation says 6:00, but does that mean that you want
people to get there at six, or the show is gonna start right at six?

Monica: The show?!

Joey: Right. Right. The wedding, gotcha. But I mean, it<U+0092>s gonna start a
little late right? I mean, weddings start late. Right?

Monica: Have you ever been to one of my weddings?

Joey: Ah. Yeah. Well look, the thing is it<U+0092>s the same day as my
niece<U+0092>s christening and I really want my parents to be there in time to see me.
<U+0091>Cause my part<U+0092>s just in the beginning I<U+0092>m not even in the rest of the
show<U+0097>Wedding!

Monica: The wedding starts at six.

Joey: Okay. Okay, I totally hear ya. Oo how about this? I vamp a little
<U+0091>til they get there?

Monica: You<U+0092>ll vamp?!

Joey: Yeah! Yeah y<U+0092>know, like warm up the crowd. Ask <U+0091>em where
they<U+0092>re from. <U+0091>Cause in Joey Tribbiani you get a minister and you get an
entertainer. I<U+0092>m a minis-tainer! (Rapping) There is no one better! There is no one
greater!

[Scene: The restaurant, continued from earlier.]

Rachel: How can you not remember us kissing?!

Melissa: I don<U+0092>t know. I don<U+0092>t remember a lot of things that never
happened.

Rachel: Wh<U+0085> Come on! Remember? We were on the sleeping porch! We
couldn<U+0092>t stop giggling? And our coconuts kept knockin<U+0092> together?

Phoebe: Oh, somewhere Joey<U+0092>s head is exploding.

Rachel: Yeah<U+0097>but come on<U+0097>Listen, I<U+0092>m sorry I don<U+0092>t want to
make you uncomfortable, but I told Phoebe that it happened and she doesn<U+0092>t believe
me.

Melissa: I<U+0092>m sorry Ray-ray. I mean if I thought it happened I would say it.
Maybe I passed out and you did stuff to me while I was sleeping.

Rachel: No!!

Phoebe: Rachel, it<U+0092>s okay. You don<U+0092>t have to do this. I believe you.
All right? Okay, if-if you say that you kissed Melissa, then you kissed Melissa.

Rachel: Thank you Phoebe.

Melissa: She didn<U+0092>t.

Phoebe: I know.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Chandler are working on the seating chart as
Ross enters carrying his tux around.]

Ross: Hey!

Monica: You just carry that around?

Ross: Yes. I find it to be something of a conversation piece. 

Monica: Between you and<U+0085>

Ross: Gunther. (To Chandler) Hey-hey! Why don<U+0092>t we put them on? Y<U+0092>know
get a picture of Batman and James Bond together.

Chandler: I would but mine doesn<U+0092>t fit. The pants are a little tight.

Monica: A little tight? I could see double-oh and seven in those pants.

Ross: Well that stinks. I was looking forward to us wearing our celebrity tuxes
together.

Chandler: Well, does that mean that you<U+0092>re not going to wearing yours?

Ross: What are you kidding? It<U+0092>s Batman<U+0092>s tux!!

Chandler: (standing up) Let me try it on!

Ross: Okay, but just the jacket. Double-oh and seven are not gettin<U+0092> in
there.

Chandler: (trying on the jacket) Okay. Holy double-vented comfort Batman! (Finds
something in the pocket) What<U+0092>s this?

Ross: What?

Chandler: An invitation for the At First Sight premiere? Oh my God! Val
Kilmer didn<U+0092>t wear this in Batman! He wore it to the premiere of some tooty-fruity
love story where he played a blind guy!

Ross: Let me see that! (Grabs the invitation and reads it.) Oh man!

Chandler: The only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell.
(Hands him the jacket and walks away.)

Joey: (entering) Hey! Uh, Monica? Chandler? Can I talk to you guys for a second?

Monica: All right that<U+0092>s it, I give up! Whatever you want you can have it!
You wanna sing a song? You wanna do a dance? You want your mom stand at the Alter and
scream racial slurs? I don<U+0092>t care!

Joey: No! No, I-I just wanna thank you guys for what you did for my parents,
that was really sweet. They<U+0092>re so happy they get to be a part of your special day.

Monica: (defeated) Oh.

Chandler: Well, you<U+0092>re welcome. And tell them we<U+0092>re really glad
they<U+0092>re coming.

Joey: Okay. I will. Ohh! Check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!
(Runs to his apartment and returns wearing a rather silly hat.) Huh? I wear it like this
when I marry you guys, and then this (He tilts it to the side of his head) is for party
time.

[Scene: Outside the restaurant, Melissa, Phoebe, and Rachel are emerging.]

Rachel: It happened! I am telling you it happened!

Melissa: Okay. (To Phoebe) Well, it was great meeting you. And uh Rachel, I-I
don<U+0092>t think I<U+0092>ll be calling you (hails a cab) because umm, y<U+0092>know
you<U+0092>ve gotten weird. (The cab pulls up.) Take care you guys.

(She<U+0092>s about to get in when<U+0085>)

Rachel: What?! Wait a minute! No wait a minute! (She does so.) Okay? Look, that
night was the one wild thing I have ever done in my entire life, and I<U+0092>m not
gonna let you take that away from me! Okay, so if you don<U+0092>t remember that, maybe
you will remember this! (She grabs Melissa and kisses her on the lips.)

Melissa: My God! You love me!

Rachel: (shocked) What?

Melissa: Of course I remember our kiss. I think about it all the time. I can
still hear the coconuts knockin<U+0092> together I<U+0085> (Phoebe is shocked.) I just
didn<U+0092>t want to tell you <U+0091>cause I didn<U+0092>t think that you<U+0092>d return my
love, and now that you have<U+0085> (Leans in to kiss Rachel.)

Rachel: (moving away) Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

Melissa: Aww, look who<U+0092>s being suddenly shy. You can<U+0092>t tell me you
don<U+0092>t feel what I feel. Nobody can kiss that good and not mean it. (Goes in again.)

Rachel: (moves away again) I-I-I-I<U+0092>m just<U+0085>I<U+0092>m just a good kisser!

Melissa: (suddenly frightened) Shut up!

Rachel: I<U+0092>m sorry!

Melissa: (laughs) Oh you don<U+0092>t have to be (Laughs again) sorry.
I<U+0092>m<U+0085>I<U+0092>m obviously kidding. I<U+0092>m not in love with you. (To Phoebe)
I<U+0092>m not in love with her. I don<U+0092>t hear coconuts banging together. Yeah, I
don<U+0092>t<U+0085>picture your face when I make love to my boyfriend. Anyway, I gotta go.
Eh<U+0085>kiss good-bye? (Rachel stares at her stunned.) No? Okay. (Hurries into the cab and
drives off.)

Rachel: Wow! I mean I had no idea that that was gonna<U+0085>

(Suddenly, Phoebe leans in and kisses her on the lips!)

Rachel: What the hell was that?!

Phoebe: I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.

Rachel: And?

Phoebe: I<U+0092>ve had better.

Ending Credits

[Scene: Ralph Lauren, Rachel is hooking Chandler up with another tuxedo.]

Chandler: (yelling from the changing room) All right! I found one that fits!

Rachel: Well y<U+0092>know what they say, the 23rd time<U+0092>s the
charm. (Chandler enters.) Aww, look at you all handsome!

Chandler: Whose is it?

Rachel: Oh does it matter?! All that matters is that you look so handsome.

Chandler: Whose is it?

Rachel: I don<U+0092>t want to say.

Chandler: Oh, come on! I don<U+0092>t care! Come on! Whose is it?

Rachel: Diane Keeton.
