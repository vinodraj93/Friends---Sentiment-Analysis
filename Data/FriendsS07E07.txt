[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is eating breakfast as Rachel enters having just woken
up.]

Joey: Morning!

Rachel: Hi! Oh, how was your date last night?

Joey: Pretty good.

Rachel: Oh good. (She walks to the closed bathroom door, opens it, and finds a
naked woman wrapped in a towel.) Ahhh! My God, sorry! (She closes the door and confronts
Joey.)

Joey: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; I<U+0092>m late for work.

Rachel: What-what?! You<U+0092>re gonna leave this person with me?!

Joey: Yeah<U+0097>Hey, don<U+0092>t worry, she<U+0092>s a terrific girl. And hey
listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that I<U+0092>m
not looking for a serious relationship; that<U+0092>d be great.

Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!

Joey: Just casually slip it in, y<U+0092>know lay the groundwork. Tell her uh,
I<U+0092>m a loner<U+0097>No! An outlaw! Tell her she doesn<U+0092>t want to get mixed up with
the likes of me.

Rachel: Y<U+0092>know what? That<U+0092>s a lot to remember, can<U+0092>t I just tell
her you<U+0092>re a pig?

Joey: Hey, I<U+0092>m gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to
do it! He<U+0092>d even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he<U+0092>d make extras and leave
<U+0091>em for me.

Rachel: Well forget it, I<U+0092>m not telling that girl anything. That is not my
responsibility.

Joey: Fine! (Pause) Now, where<U+0092>d we land on those pancakes? (She chases him
out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)


Joey<U+0092>s Date: Hi!

Rachel: Hi.


Joey<U+0092>s Date: Sorry about that, but I couldn<U+0092>t get that lock to work on
the door.

Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.


Joey<U+0092>s Date: You must be Rachel, I<U+0092>m Erin.

Rachel: Hi.

Erin: Hi. I don<U+0092>t mean this to sound like high school, but did he say
anything about me?

Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?

Opening Credits

[Scene: N.Y.U<U+0092>s University Library, Ross is entering with Chandler.]

Chandler: <U+0085>Come on! Why are we here?!

Ross: Okay, okay take a guess.

(An old woman pushes a cart full of books past.)

Chandler: The hot chicks?

Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier,
y<U+0092>know-y<U+0092>know for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral
dissertation! It<U+0092>s here! Yeah, it<U+0092>s right-it<U+0092>s right down here! In the
biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded
section behind the racks.)

Chandler: Wow that<U+0092>s actually pretty cool.

Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, there<U+0092>s also a book here by a woman named
Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next
aisle.) What is that?

Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds
do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who don<U+0092>t know what
I<U+0092>m talking about, let<U+0092>s just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the
couple gets up and runs away.)

Female Student: (as they are moving past Ross) I<U+0092>m so sorry!

Male Student: Sorry!

Chandler: You didn<U+0092>t bring me here to do that, did you?

[Scene: Monica<U+0092>s Restaurant Kitchen, Monica is cooking as a waitress enters
carrying a plate of food that has been sent back.]

Monica: She sent the chicken back again?!

The Waitress: She says it<U+0092>s to dry now and she wants to come back here and
explain to you exactly how she wants it.

Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!

(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling
water (Although, she hasn<U+0092>t taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she
can<U+0092>t be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the
following phrase.)


The Colonel: OH<U+0085>MY<U+0085>GAWD!!!! (Yep, it<U+0092>s Janice.)

Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around
to face the planet<U+0092>s most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of
course. She<U+0092>s the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.

Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the
best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)

Monica: I<U+0092>m fine.

Janice: (notices Monica<U+0092>s engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your
finger?! I<U+0092>m blind!

Monica: Oh<U+0085> Uh<U+0085>

Janice: So, who<U+0092>s the lucky guy?

[Cut to Monica and Chandler<U+0092>s just after Monica has finished telling Chandler what
happened.]

Chandler: OH<U+0085>MY<U+0085>GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You
didn<U+0092>t tell her we were getting married, did you?

Monica: Well, she saw the ring.

Chandler: Did she freak out?

Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most
people.

Chandler: Right.

Monica: Well, she actually has a boyfriend y<U+0092>know herself, named Clark. Uh,
she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.

Chandler: (laughs) You said no right?

Monica: Huh?

Chandler: You said no right?!

Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what
was I supposed to do?!

Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The check<U+0092>s in the mail! Oh your baby
is so cute! I can<U+0092>t wait to read your book Ross!!

Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it won<U+0092>t be so bad.

Chandler: What do you think she<U+0092>s just gonna sit there quietly? You
don<U+0092>t think she<U+0092>s gonna want to make a toast? You don<U+0092>t think she<U+0092>s
gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!

Monica: Oh my God, she<U+0092>s not gonna like the chicken that night either is
she?!

Chandler: Y<U+0092>know what? It<U+0092>s gonna be okay. Y<U+0092>know what?
She<U+0092>s probably not gonna even want to come.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?

Monica: So-so you would<U+0092>ve just lied?

Chandler: Yes!!

Monica: Would it really have been that easy?

Chandler: Yes!!!

Monica: Good, so do it Saturday night because we<U+0092>re going to dinner with
her and Clark.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and
someone else with her back turned is there.]

Joey: Hey! What<U+0092>s up?


Phoebe and Rachel: Hey!

Joey: Hey-hey, who<U+0092>s your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey,
startling him) Hey!!

Erin: Hey Joey!

Joey: Erin! Still here!

Rachel: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!

Joey: Why wouldn<U+0092>t ya? Erin is great! Then-then there<U+0092>s you guys.

Erin: Ohh, listen. I<U+0092>ve got to get going. Today was great, thanks!

Rachel: I know!

Phoebe: Okay!

Erin: Bye Joey. (Kisses him.) Last night was fun.

Joey: Yeah. I<U+0092>ll uh, I<U+0092>ll call ya.

Rachel: Oh and I<U+0092>ll call ya too!

Erin: Or I<U+0092>ll call you!

Phoebe: And call me!

Joey: (to Erin) Okay, good to see you again.

Erin: Bye.

Joey: Bye-bye.

Rachel: Bye!

(Joey closes the door behind her.) 

Joey: So, system kinda broke down huh?!

Rachel: Oh Joey, I<U+0092>m sorry I just couldn<U+0092>t tell her all those things
you wanted me to tell her. And y<U+0092>know we got to talking and I<U+0085>

Phoebe: We want you to marry her!

Joey: What?!!

Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.

Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?

Rachel: Cupid.

Phoebe: Joey, she<U+0092>s so cool. She speaks four languages.

Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!

Rachel: Look Joey, come on she<U+0092>s so perfect for you! I mean she<U+0092>s
sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.

Joey: My beers?! Look you guys, she<U+0092>s a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good
time, but I just<U+0097>I don<U+0092>t see it going anywhere.

Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.

Joey: Look I<U+0092>m sorry you guys, I-I just don<U+0092>t think so.

Phoebe: Whatever.

Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)

Joey: Hey, don<U+0092>t start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? You<U+0092>re the one
who<U+0092>s in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, you<U+0092>re the one
having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!

Rachel: Phoebe!

Phoebe: Secret affair!

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.]

Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!

Rachel: I<U+0092>m sorry?

Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it,
and there were students makin<U+0092> babies right in the middle of the Paleontology
section!

Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?

Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on
campus where students went to uh, fool around.

Rachel: Yeah, there was. It was<U+0097>there the corner of the library where-where
all these dusty books that nobody ever read<U+0097>Yes, there was.

Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think it<U+0092>s like uh-a thing!

Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?

Ross: Oh for cryin<U+0092> out loud! (He storms out.)

Joey: All right, so we should go catch our movie.

Rachel: Well now what<U+0092>s the rush?

Joey: I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.

Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!

Rachel: Well look who<U+0092>s here!

Erin: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Erin: Joey.

Joey: Erin.

Erin: Hey Rachel.

Rachel: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!

Erin: What<U+0092>s wrong?

Rachel: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.

Phoebe: Oh no.

Joey: (skeptical) What party?


Phoebe and Rachel: A birthday party.

Joey: Who<U+0092>s birthday party?


Phoebe and Rachel: Allison<U+0092>s birthday party.

Joey: (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?


Phoebe and Rachel: 32. (Joey<U+0092>s not buying it.)

Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why don<U+0092>t you guys do
something?!

Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on
duty.]

Ross: Excuse me. Hi, I<U+0092>m a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology
section, fifth floor, stack 437?

The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian
brings his boss over.)

The Head Librarian: How can I help you?

Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the
Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people
are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.

The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns
to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, I<U+0092>m afraid the
library is very understaffed. I, I can<U+0092>t help you.

Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if I<U+0092>m the only person with any appreciation of
the sanctity of the written word, I<U+0092>ll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to
do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And don<U+0092>t you follow me!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: How did it go with Erin?

Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!

Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, you<U+0092>re not, you<U+0092>re not mad at us anymore?

Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the
first time we went out. Y<U+0092>know? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.

Phoebe: Didn<U+0092>t you sleep together?

Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves
sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever
to have kids, well that<U+0092>s a<U+0085>

Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkin<U+0092> about having kids. Oh my
Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please don<U+0092>t get married before I do.

Joey: Okay.

[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark,
however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.]

Janice: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!

Monica: He might still show up.

Janice: Oh, what are you, stupid? It<U+0092>s been three hours.

Monica: Is that all?

Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why don<U+0092>t you
tell about your lovely wedding?

Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the
wedding. Um, it<U+0092>s going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! We<U+0092>re not even sure
why we<U+0092>re having it.

Monica: It<U+0092>s actually going to be just family.

Janice: Oh<U+0085>wait<U+0085>you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you
something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In
Red?

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and
Rachel are already there.]

Joey: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!

Erin: What about Benitez?

Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?

Erin: What about shut up?

Joey: You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin)
I<U+0092>ll be right back. 

Erin: Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)

Rachel: So how<U+0092>s it goin<U+0092> with Joey?

Erin: Uh, okay.

Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me
that you like him.

Erin: Look, he<U+0092>s a really great guy and I know that you really want
this to work out, but I just don<U+0092>t see this having a future.

Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just
change your mind?!

Erin: Kinda.

Phoebe: Then change it back!

Erin: I<U+0092>m sorry I<U+0085> It<U+0092>s just there<U+0092>s no real spark.

Phoebe: No spark? Didn<U+0092>t you sleep together?

Erin: Yeah.

Rachel: Ugh, tramp!

Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?

Erin: I really don<U+0092>t think he does. And y<U+0092>know what? Maybe you guys
could help clue him in. Y<U+0092>know, tell him I<U+0092>m-I<U+0092>m not interested in a
serious relationship or something.

Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that you<U+0092>re kind of a loner.

Erin: Yeah! That would be great!

Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that you<U+0092>re a real (She says something in Italian,
and it doesn<U+0092>t matter what she said. It<U+0092>s not important so I don<U+0092>t need
everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)

Erin: I<U+0092>m sorry?

Phoebe: Oh well, I guess Italian isn<U+0092>t one of the four languages you speak.

Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?

Erin: Yeah, let<U+0092>s go.

Joey: Okay. See you guys later.

Erin: Bye guys.

Rachel: Yeah, see ya.

Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)

Rachel: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.

Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

[Scene: The library<U+0092>s Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks
up.]

Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?

Guy: Yeah, we were<U+0085>we were just looking around.

Ross: Oh-oh, you<U+0092>re-you<U+0092>re fellow scholars. What exactly were you
looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester
Stock<U+0092>s musings on the Smiledon Californicus?

Guy: Uhh<U+0085>.

Ross: Ah<U+0085> Ah<U+0085>Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts
looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the
section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marion<U+0092>s views
on evolution?

Woman: Uh, actually I find Marion<U+0092>s views far to progressionist.

Ross: I find Marion<U+0092>s views far to progressionist.

Woman: I<U+0092>m sorry, who are you?

Ross: I<U+0092>m a professor here uh, Ross<U+0085>Geller.

Woman: Ross Geller, why do I know that name? It<U+0092>s uh<U+0097>Wait! (Grabs his
book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?

Ross: Yes! You<U+0092>re the person who checked out my book?!

Woman: Y<U+0092>know, you look nothing like I would<U+0092>ve thought.
You<U+0092>re<U+0085>you<U+0092>re so young.

Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.

[Time Lapse, Ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing
in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.]

Ross: I am very<U+0085>very sorry.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are watching TV as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Phoebe: So how was, how was your date?

Joey: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this
ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but still<U+0085> And guess what, I<U+0092>m
thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.

Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?

Joey: No-no-no-no-no! It<U+0092>s a surprise, but it<U+0092>s gonna be tricky
thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.


Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.

Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the
feeling from her today that uh, she<U+0092>s not lookin<U+0092> for a serious relationship.

Joey: Where are you gettin<U+0092> this?

Rachel: Well, she told me. She said she<U+0092>s kinda a loner.

Joey: Oh. Oh.

Rachel: Joey<U+0085>

Joey: No hey Rach, it<U+0092>s cool okay? Y<U+0092>know I<U+0092>m a loner too! (Heads
for his room.) Right?

Phoebe: Hey Joey, y<U+0092>know what? You are way to good for her.

Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and
tell <U+0091>em you<U+0092>re not looking for a relationship.

Joey: No! No. Don<U+0092>t do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.

Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?

Joey: Yeah?

Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?

Joey: (coming back out) Finally!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen
table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.]

Monica: What are we gonna do?

Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.

(There<U+0092>s a knock on the door and Janice enters.)

Janice: Chandler?

Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?

Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I
just felt I couldn<U+0092>t really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door
behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was
wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with
family.

Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren<U+0092>t they?

Janice: Please, it<U+0092>s because otherwise I really don<U+0092>t know what I
might do.

Chandler: Aren<U+0092>t you just a tinsy bit curious?

Janice: (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?

Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.

Janice: Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)

Monica: We<U+0092>ll just<U+0085>we<U+0092>ll just let her stay.

Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!

Monica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.

Chandler: Is that what you<U+0092>re thinking about right now?

Monica: I never stop thinking about it.

Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I
take my bath.

Chandler: Janice, I<U+0092>m sorry but umm, you can<U+0092>t stay here tonight.

Janice: Why not?

Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now
Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.

(And she does the laugh.)

Janice: Okay, I<U+0092>m going to need a comforter, but did you have a
hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you
have a cat? <U+0091>Cause it<U+0092>s already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear
that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)

(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!

Janice: Why?

Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!

Janice: He does?

Chandler: Say again?

Monica: That<U+0092>s right. That<U+0092>s right. And that is why you can<U+0092>t
stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn<U+0092>t come to the wedding.

Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.

Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you
can.

Janice: Oh<U+0085>my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, I<U+0092>ll go. (Starts
for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.
Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)

Ending Credits

[Scene: The library<U+0092>s Paleontology section, Ross is on patrol and stops a security
guard through the stack of books.]

Ross: (to the guard) Don<U+0092>t sweat it, I<U+0092>ve got this section covered.
Yeah, in fact I<U+0092>ve got this little baby (Turns on a mini-flashlight) to shine in
people<U+0092>s eye<U+0097>(The guard walks away)<U+0097>Okay, see you later. 

(Ross resumes his patrol when his best friend and sister walk up and start to take off
their coats, but they stop when they see him.)

Chandler: I just wanted to show Monica your book. (Ross just glares at him.)
